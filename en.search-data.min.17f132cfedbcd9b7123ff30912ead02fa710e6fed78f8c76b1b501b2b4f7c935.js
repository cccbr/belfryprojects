Ringing bells full circle is not just a church activity; it is part of our national heritage. A four hundred year old tradition, it offers challenges and requires skills which most people are able to achieve. Whilst it is based at the parish church and is a part of the worshipping Christian community, a band of ringers is part of the social life of the parish. It brings together people of all ages from all walks of life to participate in an absorbing and fascinating hobby.
A ring of bells will last for many years without major expense, requiring only routine checks and minor maintenance which can be carried out by a suitable experienced Steeple Keeper. Guidance on this can be found in a companion document. In time, however, more major work may be necessary. This will require specialists and contractors, and this document provides advice about how to plan and manage a project involving tower bells and their installation. This is not a technical manual for doing any of the work being considered, even though local volunteers may assist professional bell hangers and other contractors with some of the work.
Figure 1: Refurbished bells delivered back to the church ready for rehanging
Figure 1 gives a taste of what might be involved. The ring of 6 bells at Elkstone, Gloucestershire, were taken out by a bell hanger (with volunteer help). They were retuned and new fittings added. Here they are returned to the church ready for rehanging. Two of these bells were cast in 1657.
For Non-Ringers # Anyone familiar with bell ringing can skip this section but, recognising that this document may be read by non-ringers, the following may be helpful. Further information is given on the website of the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers. A ring of bells installed for full circle change ringing usually comprises between 5 and 12 bells, each weighing several cwt to a ton or more (200kg – 1000kg). The total weight of the bells alone in a tower is therefore considerable. When installed in a tower, the bells together form an integral part of a large mechanical musical instrument. Each bell is rung by one ringer in a band.
The sound is not in the form of tunes as from most other musical instruments, but as sequences of mathematical “changes”. Each bell strikes just once as it is rotated one way through a full circle then back again. The installation in the tower therefore has to be substantial enough to withstand the forces imposed as the bells are rotated.
Bell ringers are members of the local community as bells are rung not just for church events but also to mark local, national and even international occasions. Change ringing has a history of over four hundred years. It offers challenges and requires both physical and mental skills, with insights into complex mathematics, history, engineering, technology, communities and geography. Ringing brings together people of all age groups and with diverse interests – history, travel, mathematics, engineering and – increasingly – computing, to name but a few.
The use of specialist jargon in these notes will be limited but some is unavoidable; this is where ringers and specialists will need to assist.
Ownership of the Bells # With the exception of a few private rings, the ringers do not ‘own’ the bells. About 90% of bells hung for full-circle ringing are in hung in Church of England churches. Within the Church of England those responsible for the tower and bells are usually the Churchwardens and the Parochial Church Council (PCC). The legal ownership of the bells is vested in the Churchwardens. The PCC has a duty for the use, maintenance and insurance of the bells.
In other towers, and other jurisdictions, there will usually be what we will term an Authorising Body that will have a legal responsibility for the tower and its contents. In such cases, different policies and procedures may have to be adopted and arrangements and permissions must be obtained from the appropriate authorities. Further details are given in the Belfry Upkeep document.
Scope of this Document # Who may wish to read it # Bell ringers considering a restoration project for the bells that they ring. The owner or people responsible for a bell tower - such as church or cathedral clergy, other church workers and volunteers, perhaps with little knowledge of bells and ringing. Third parties with related interests. It will be the Authorising Body and local bell ringers who are most likely to consider the work required and how it can be achieved. For the leader of the project, some knowledge of bell ringing and some engineering or technical knowledge will be helpful, as will experience of organising activities. Planning and undertaking a bell project may seem daunting as few people will have done anything similar before, but a leader with a small team will enjoy working together to achieve a successful outcome.
How the document may help # There are several circumstances which may result in the need for a project involving a bell installation:
The bells have become difficult to ring safely and reliably, limiting the ringing and, more importantly, making it difficult to teach new ringers. A church with no bells hung for full circle ringing may wish to install a full ring as a witness to the life of the church. There may be a wish to augment the number of existing bells. This provides more variety in the ringing (provided, of course, that the tower can raise a capable band). More rarely there may be an ambitious project to install new bells in an existing tower or even in a new purpose designed and constructed tower, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: Church of the Transfiguration, Orleans, MA 02653 USA – a new church building dedicated in 2000, bells installed 2010
Each project will be unique, often in a historic building, requiring design work, traditional craft skills, as well as the use of appropriate equipment, tools and facilities. Specialist advice will be required. There are also permissions and regulations that need to be considered.
There will be concern about the likely expense. However, fund raising for bell projects is often very successful, with considerable sums raised by a wide variety of means.
Fund raising and the project itself can also become a focus and stimulus for not just those immediately involved but many other groups of people locally and further afield.
Bells not hung for change ringing # Figure 3: : Single bell on The Old Town Hall, Denbigh
Not all bells are hung for full circle change ringing. Some may be a carillon with many bells, a chime of just a few bells, or a single bell, as shown in Figure 3. The technical arrangements of these installations will be different, less demanding structurally for some, but planning and implementing a project will be similar in many respects.
Other Work in Bell Towers # Usually with the best intentions, some churches may propose work that could adversely affect the installation or ringing of the bells. Ringers should be aware of this. Occasionally, work is proposed in a tower or church that could affect the bells, their installation or ringing of the bells, even though the main focus of the work is not the bell installation itself. For example, there may be plans to create meeting rooms, kitchen or toilet facilities in the building. Such changes may affect the access to the spaces required by the bell ringers as they ring the bells, and the access to the bell chamber. Even if only rarely required, it must be possible to access and even remove the bells from tower and this is usually only via trap doors in all the floors and ceilings from ground level to the bell chamber.
There are examples of towers where rings of bells are now unusable and inaccessible in towers. For example, a former church is now a pub and the bells are not accessible for ringing. Another church is still open for worship but the tower has been converted to offices with no public access to the bells which remain in situ, and the former ringing room contains equipment. It is therefore essential that experienced bell ringers contribute advice to make sure that the alterations will not adversely affect routine access and use of the ringing room, the bell chamber or ringing in any way. Bell ringers may also be able to suggest how the project may offer potential for improvements to the ringing environment.
The best protection against this happening is for the ringers to maintain close liaison with their tower Authorising Body, contributing to any proposals and providing information on the needs of the ringers and the bell installation. Unfortunately, this cannot be the case where the tower has no ringers. This is a difficult situation but ringers at neighbouring towers, with help from the local Guild or Association, may be able to assist.

`}),e.add({id:1,href:"/docs/020-scoping-project/",title:"Scoping the Project",section:"Docs",content:` Scoping the Project # Of the over 7000 rings of bells in the world, around 90% are within the jurisdiction of the Church of England (CoE). We will use terms such as \u0026lsquo;incumbent\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;church wardens\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;Parochial Church Council (PCC)\u0026rsquo; in this document. We trust you can translate these into the equivalent terms in other jurisdictions. A bell project may start as the seed of an idea or it may already have been discussed in a committee such as the Parochial Church Council (PCC). This chapter suggests how to develop the initial ideas so that other people may become involved and start to appreciate what may be achieved. This will help the project come to a successful completion. No two projects will be the same so these notes offer guidance that may be considered rather than a step by step guide.
Inception and Generation of Initial Ideas # Whose idea is it? # A project involving tower bells may be proposed by one of several individuals or groups. It may be bell ringers but others such as the incumbent, church members or local parishioners interested in the tower and bells may also have suggestions. They will have various motivations depending on their interests and expectations, views and opinions.
Preliminary formalities # Regardless of who suggested the project, ideas should be discussed informally at an early stage with the tower authority, normally the church wardens and PCC for towers within the Church of England. Some Incumbents, church wardens and PCC members will not be familiar with change ringing so it is advisable for ringers to help them understand what is involved in the activity, particularly if there are no bells in the tower or they have not been rung recently. A good way to help people understand is to visit the tower to see any existing installation along with a demonstration of change ringing by the ringers, if it is safe to do so. A visit to other towers to see experienced ringers in action will often be helpful and ringers are usually very willing to demonstrate what is involved - ringing encompasses much more than just pulling a rope or even switching on a switch! Ringers will also offer explanations of the mathematics, engineering, travel, history and team-work that ringing offers.
The tower authority should appoint a project leader and may suggest team members to help. At this stage there will not be permission to go ahead with the project itself. Further discussions will be necessary at PCC meetings with decisions recorded formally at various stages in PCC minutes. An initial project team will gather information and ideas, then consider what the project could achieve, the benefits for the short, medium and longer term, and how it may be accomplished.
The team should be open to suggestions. Different people with different experiences and views will bring new ideas that should be considered and included for consideration. Support and help will be needed from many others – it should not be a “vanity project” for one or a few people with vested interests!
Why is the project proposed? # Bell projects may be proposed for various reasons:
improve the mechanical condition of an existing bell installation – often the motivation of change ringers improve safety and the environment for users, including ringers add one or more bells to an existing ring – perhaps the ringers’ idea, but there may be other reasons such as a benevolent donor or legacy for a lasting memorial install a new ring of bells – a tower without any bells? attract and enthuse new ringers, particularly young people – probably as part of a larger campaign in the church make better use of space available and install facilities – toilets, kitchens, meeting rooms, concert venues – a more versatile building welcome new users from the community to the building \u0026hellip; but be cautious! Not everyone will immediately be enthusiastic about the project! Some projects will be highly contentious and it is essential that the needs of ringers are considered alongside those of other users and vice versa. This is particularly important at towers with little or no regular ringing and no local ringers.
Aim for many benefits for many people for many years! How big will the project be? # Use imagination! Initially, do not worry about practicalities or money – consider what could be done ideally and develop those as the aims. What may be viewed as a large commitment for a small rural parish may be less daunting for a large, high profile parish church or cathedral. No idea is a bad idea, “brainstorm” with others to generate suggestions. It will be easier to attract funds to an ambitious project that meets the aspirations of many, than a small project that satisfies the interests of few. Later it may be necessary to compromise, so separate and develop the ideas later. Remember that the outcomes of bell projects will last for 20, 50, 100 years or more and there will be few opportunities for amendments once the project is complete.
The main focus of the project may be bell related, but a church project may include more extensive work of which the bells are just one part. Although these notes focus on bell projects, bell ringers themselves may benefit from other work that may be included in larger projects. For example, space may be converted to provide more suitable accommodation for a wider cross-section of the local community, with different interests and age groups. Modern designs incorporate level access for wheelchairs and the less mobile, kitchen and toilet facilities and self-contained meeting rooms of various sizes, that are practical and efficient. For ringers, these may offer facilities for meetings, training and events. a new ringing room or gallery may enable bell ringers in action to be viewed from the body of the church if a suitable glazed screen is incorporated in the design. the ringing room separated from the body of the church will be easier to heat. a shorter rope length may also help ringing if the draught is excessive (a ceiling height of less than about 12 feet (about 4 metres) is not recommended). Figure 1: Extension under construction at Eastnor, Herefordshire, to accommodate disabled toilet, storage and food servery
Consider whether other work should be undertaken at the same time as a bell project. Could scaffold and lifting gear be used for other work around the tower? This may seem more complicated and expensive but for the longer term, it may be more cost-effective overall. What should be done first and what left until later? Remember that work in the tower will inevitably disturb dirt and debris so leave the installation of new and cleaned items until later, if at all possible.
The bell work may be part of a larger programme of work in the church or a more limited project affecting the bells and bell installation alone. Remember that bell installations last for decades and centuries, and there will be few opportunities for major alterations once the project is complete. For a church project, make sure that changes do not limit the scope for further bell related work.
Further information is available here (PDF).
When does it need to be finished? # Is there a date by which the project needs to be completed that will determine the timeline? Can the project be linked with a specific anniversary or event, whether local or national? The Millennium, Royal Jubilee and Coronation, the end of hostilities during World Wars 1 and 2, and church anniversaries have all been marked by bell projects. Sometimes it is other work that sets the timescale – the demolition of an existing church hall to raise money from a residential development makes alterations in the church a priority.

Considering risks # It is equally important to consider risks that may be encountered at each stage in the project; how will they be monitored and how would they be mitigated if they arose. Considering risks is part of project management.
Specialist Advice and Information # A lot of advice will be required during the project; information on how and where to obtain specialist advice is offered in the next chapter.
Other Supporting Information # Information and facts, personalities and stories associated with the bells and ringers will be very useful when writing proposals for grants and raising funds. Information will be available in church archives and diocesan records, as well as a public library, county archives and old copies of local newspapers. Members of local history and archaeology groups may have or be willing to assist in gathering information. Local residents, especially those from families who have been in the area for several generations may have their own memoires and records. Memorials and gravestones may suggest who may be able to help.

Stakeholder Views # Even for the smallest project, encourage and involve others – one person cannot think of every possibility. There will be many stakeholders locally and more widely, not all of whom will be known at the start, and some will have views that differ from those more directly involved in the project. The project team should think laterally and take time to “brainstorm” together to identify all possible stakeholders. Invite them to consider and contribute. Ideally identify then contact appropriate named people rather than cold-calling.
Capture any offers of help as there will be many ways in which volunteers will be able to assist later as members and supporters of the project team. Even if people cannot help, they may know others who could have information or who can support. Offers of help may well reduce costs that will be incurred, and those offering will build their own personal experiences or business interests.
Presentation of Outline Proposals # Once the scope of the project has been developed sufficiently, it will be timely to present the project to more people, to gain their interest and ideas. Prepare information about the project using various formats - as talks and presentations, displays, leaflets, podcasts, videos, sketches, diagrams, models, artefacts etc. Various versions will be required for diverse audiences such as young people and school children, neighbours and local residents, local organisations or companies, etc.
As well as organising special events, take the opportunity to add information to other events and media. For example, parish meetings, church groups and events in the locality. Be imaginative – can historical aspects be presented to primary school children, and scouts and guides? Such events will raise questions and prompt debate – they are all opportunities to recruit potential ringers, encourage support and defuse any concerns. Every event is likely to lead to more ideas and more questions. But be cautious, what may seem to be minor details may stimulate heated debate, such as the colour of a new carpet!
Refine and Improve the Initial Ideas # Once initial ideas have been collected, the incumbent and PCC should discuss the project and agree for it to be planned in detail by a project team. This will still not include permission to go ahead with the work!
The bells and associated installation # For ringers, these are some of the key issues:
Figure 4: A new bell being cast by Meighs \u0026amp; Westleys
If new bells are proposed, then how many, and of what weights? Is augmentation really needed? Will the outcome facilitate the attraction, training and retention of ringers? Is there a need for a fourth ring of 10 bells within a few miles? How big or strong is the tower structure? Adding 2 bells to a heavier ring of 8 will enable a lighter tuneful 6 to be rung Explore options carefully, without just jumping to conclusions! Does the clock use the same bells, is there a chiming mechanism? Will this be restored or removed as part of the project? What is to be retained, what should be disposed of, what could be added? What of all the component parts can be retained, repaired, reused elsewhere, recycled? What other improvements should be made? # Before work is underway consider the need for the following:
Variable sound control so that neighbours are not disturbed by ringing Improved access to higher levels of the tower and roof, including to enable tower tours Roof or gutter repairs Addition of safety features (e.g. improved staircase, handrails, steps, walk ways and ladders) Weather and bird protection for the tower Sound management externally (for neighbours) and internally for ringers Security (improved doors and windows, locks, alarms) Electrical supplies, lightning conductor, emergency lighting Renewal and / or treatment of metal and timberwork in tower Removal of debris and clutter, unused items such as pipework and cables As well as ringing the bells, ringers and others will need to access the tower and bells periodically. They will need to check the conditions and undertake routine maintenance, as well as putting on and taking off bell muffles. More rarely, even the bells or larger parts of the installation may need to be removed down through the tower. Access must therefore be left available, with trap doors through each floor.
Other details to support ringing # The opportunity should be seized to create a better environment for recruiting, teaching and retaining new ringers, and engaging with the wider church and local communities

Practical considerations # Work in a bell tower inevitably disturbs or creates a considerable amount of dust and debris, some accumulated over decades or centuries. Care must be taken to protect other fabric and fittings in the building during the work, especially those that are fragile or delicate. Items such as memorials, lectern, wood and stonework may need covering. For the most sensitive items like the organ, this may demand a separate contract from an organ builder.
Doorways, floors and staircases may need to be protected when heavy items are being moved and at points where scaffolding is to be erected. External accesses, storage and workspaces will also have to be planned.
For surplus materials and items generated in the course of the project, plan how they will be reused, recycled or their disposal. Some items may be reused as removed from the tower or after being refurbished. Rather than disposing of items, enterprising and creative volunteers may be able turn old timber or metal pieces into souvenirs for sale. Component parts that are no longer serviceable may still be sold and support fund raising. Note that disposal of certain church assets is covered by Faculty Rules.
Fund raising # The overriding concern for many will be how a bell project can be afforded. In all but exceptional cases, there will be a need to raise money, often what will seem to be quite a substantial sum. The question of money needs to be borne in mind while scoping the project but in a balanced way – not too optimistic or too pessimistic. It is likely to be easier to raise the funds for an ambitious, more costly project with wide community benefits than a smaller scale project only likely to support the few local bell ringers. Be brave and hopeful – the money will come.
There are a few grant awarding organisations that specialise in supporting bell related project but the majority of charitable funders now expect any project to benefit a wider group of beneficiaries than just bell ringers or even the church alone.
Potential funders will need to be convinced about who will benefit and how, in the short, medium and longer term. The project needs to be made relevant for a significant part of the local community, interesting and fun! It will be necessary to demonstrate how the work will benefit many people from diverse groups, particularly those who are normally not typically engaged, and last for a long time, years and decades, not just weeks and months.
Once the scale and approximate cost of the project is known, it will be appropriate to launch a fund raising campaign.
Scope creep # While it is appropriate to aim for a project that makes best use of the time and effort that will be devoted to it, be cautious that the scope of the project does not become too ambitious. Play devil’s advocate and challenge carefully additional features that are suggested to ensure that they will add the value anticipated.
Ringing and Ringers While the Project is Underway # If there is an existing band of ringers, consider how they will continue to ring while the bells are out of action. They may be able to support ringing at neighbouring towers and this may be the opportunity for them to experience different numbers and weights of bells. Plan how the ringers will keep in contact with each other and the progress of the project, especially if they are unable to ring elsewhere for some reason.
If the tower has few or no ringers, how will a new band be recruited and trained as part of the project? Volunteers from nearby towers may help recruit lapsed ringers and prospective ringers. Willingness, enthusiasm and determination to succeed is required, whether they are regular churchgoers or not. This is covered in the companion document Running a Tower. In addition, The Association of Ringing Teachers supports ringing teachers and recruiting new ringers, and the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers provides some resources for recruiting new ringers.
The most satisfying thing of all is for your new band to ring at the dedication service.
Getting Approval and Permission to go Ahead # Once the scope of the project has been outlined in detail, the Project Leader will finalise the details, and draw up all the documentation. First it will be the tower authorities who will have to give permission for the project to go ahead and they in turn will need to be convinced that all the information required for higher level approvals is available.

As a project takes shape there may be enthusiasm to make progress, particularly start raising money. However, it is advisable to plan the project, considering in some detail what has to be done when, how, by whom, with what resources first. The plan will ideally run from the earliest discussions through to project completion. Careful planning should reduce the overall duration, save money and make sure that the whole project runs smoothly and meets its aims.
Asking who, what, when, where, why, how, are useful prompts at every stage! There is a wide range of material available about planning and running projects. Look for basic guides online and in books (public libraries and bookstalls at larger stations may stock some). A focus on charities and the voluntary sector is most likely to be helpful for bell projects. There is no “right” way to manage a project so this guidance should be adjusted to fit the specific project.
A particularly comprehensive set of information about church projects is here.
Scheduling activities # The project leader will usually consider the project in stages, with each stage reaching a logical point, for example:
Scoping the project - concept definition and information gathering Requesting permission and detailed planning Selecting contractors and placing contracts Undertaking the work off site and on site Completion and close down
Key dates, activities, their durations and milestones should be planned in conjunction with those involved, i.e. stakeholders, contractors and suppliers.
Much of the detailed work in each stage will be managed by various contractors, but coordinating their activities is a key role of the project leader. Not every activity needs to be sequential and time will be saved if activities are accomplished in parallel whenever possible.
Be realistic when planning the timetable, not optimistic, as approvals and tasks often take longer than anticipated. At every stage consider the risks and include contingencies to prevent the whole project timescale drifting. The risk is that when time is short, people and activities may be rushed, so accidents and errors may increase. But leaving time for contingencies is not an excuse for poor planning.
Identify clearly the key dates that have to be fixed. For example, a decision making committee may only meet once a quarter, so find out when their meetings will be held, when they need information to be submitted, and note these in the plan.
Plan meetings with stakeholders, contractors and suppliers. While some meetings may now be virtual, face to face meetings are still very effective and often enable better personal interaction, especially in the early stages of a project. Meetings help to keep everyone up to date with progress and also offer the opportunity to ask questions. If on site, then progress will be much more apparent.
Watch what interdependencies there may between various activities;changes in the timing of one activity will affect others that follow.For example, specific equipment and materials will be required at precise times, with some requiring large areas for storage and security until used.
Careful consideration of phasing may enable money to be saved; for example, can the period during whichitems are hiredbe minimised, to reduce hire costs?
For every activity in the plan, consider carefully who else needs to be involved and what else will be needed. Talking through each activity with members of the project team may expose key points that are easily overlooked yet may be critical and time consuming. When and how will reports be required for the PCC, funders and other stakeholders–verbal, written, electronic / on paper? Reports at specific times may be essential for funders so should not be missed! Adding them to the plan, with time allocated for preparation, may take a few minutes, but can save problems and potentiallyloss of income.
Some grant awarding bodies require reports, data and other actionsboth during and after the project is complete, some even a few years after the project has been finished. Plan how this will be achieved, even as team members change and show how that data and information will be collected as the project proceeds.
How will progress, changes to the plan or changes of approach be notified to others and recorded? This is all part of good communication–whether by phone, email or electronic tools. It is easy to overlook people who may wish or need to be informed, so setting up specific mailing lists is a wise and efficient way of working.
At the end of the project, leave time to complete all the formalities and tidy up. There may be additional correspondence to be completed so these must be added to records as they are archived for future reference.
Lack of planning can lead to what are described as “Unforseen consequences” but they may be the result of poor planning! Ultimately, project management ensures that everything happens, when and how it should!
Project Management tools # It is advisable for the project leader to set up systematic ways of managing the project. Comprehensive software packages are available, some very expensive, others freely available, but these are not necessary. It is more important for all those involved to be able to access information and use it. The normal cautions apply if free software is used.
Calendar # A calendar is a good way of showing the start and end dates of activities in each stage, along with specific milestones (GLOSSARY ***), deadlines and events highlighted. Larger projects involving other work in the church are likely to be divided into major phases, only one of which may directly concern the bells.
A long term project may aim first to replace ageing electrical, plumbing and heating systems, then the addition of audio visual aids and wifi. This may be followed by repairs to tower stonework, creation of an accessible entrance and restoration of the bells. Phase 3 could be a building extension with kitchen, serving hatch, meeting rooms and toilet. Each phase would be run as if a separate project, but with careful planning for activities that are interdependent, such as anticipating electrical work in phase 1 for the building extensions in phase 3. An online calendar enables team members to share and update information as progress is made. Online calendars usually offer the option to show different levels of detail.
A large wall planner displayed at a central location such as in the church, is useful to show progress against key milestones.
Project Information Documents and Records # Information and documents will be generated and received during a project, including key more formal decisions and agreements, as well as useful reference materials. Much of this will be referred to during the project and key documents must be archived on completion. For example:
Calendars showing project timetable Records of activities, meeting agendas and minutes, events, progress reports Terms of reference and appointments for key people Contact details (respecting GDPR) Formal contract documents, permissions (respecting commercial confidentiality) Financial records, bank statements Correspondence Event arrangements Presentations, displays Physical artefacts Risk register Health and safety information Reference documents – useful information The project leader should develop systematic ways of managing information and documentation, including how it can be shared. Most will be in electronic format but some items will still be received on paper particularly those that require wet signatures. A scanned copy of these will be useful, but originals should be retained and archived at the end of the project.
A clear file name convention, good version control, and backup system is essential from the start of the project, as it will save a lot of time, especially as the volume of information expands. Sorting after the project has started is not easy!
Information from suppliers and contractors may be commercially sensitive so should be identified distinctly and handled appropriately. Personal information (contact details, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses etc) must be stored and managed so that only appropriate people have access to it and consistent with the requirements of [GDPR GLOSSARY](Link to CCCBR pdf). A specific statement should define how personal data will be managed in the project, probably based on that set out by the church concerned.
Some grant awarding bodies require reports, data and other actions during and after the project is complete, some even a few years after the project has been finished so plan for this as the project proceeds.
Photographic records # Photographs and videos are easy to take electronically and will be useful when creating a complete documentary record of the project from the very start through to completion that can be preserved as part of the tower history. As well as being useful, informative and interesting, pictures are helpful as reminders of the status of the project at certain points as well useful publicity in the course of the project. Perhaps enlist the support of members of a local photographic society as they may be willing to be involved in a more unusual project themselves. Bell towers are often dark and cramped so will pose interesting challenges even for the most enthusiastic amateur photographers!
Money Management Links to Finance chapter *** # Formally, money for the project is likely to the responsibility of the Church Treasurer as they will have the authority for payments and bank transactions. However, a project treasurer can help the project leader with costing the work, review financial elements of quotations and contracts, then control and manage project funds as income is received and payments are made. Good record keeping is essential and many grant awarding bodies will expect evidence of expenditure and related financial records.
Cash flow will be a concern i.e. when more money has to be paid out before it has been raised or received. Contractors will set out the payment terms in their contract and some money may be required in advance, with further stage payments once specific work has been completed. The dates on which payments are due should be included the calendar.
Running the project # Once all the plans and approvals are in place, along with evidence of the money being available, then the project can start and can become frenetic!
Who will have the last ring on the old bells? This is likely to be a question asked by ringers so plans are likely to include the last quarter peal, last peal and last general ringing. Plan who will be involved in each of these events and use them as publicity opportunities.
Decommissioning and Preparations # Preliminary work will usually be required before external contractors can start the bell related work – for example, in clearing items that are in routine use – chairs, tables, books, papers etc. Are they to be retained in storage, refurbished or disposed of?
It may be necessary to provide protective sheeting and covering for immovable items like flooring, monuments, organ to prevent damage, and ingress of dust or debris.
Volunteer labour may undertake some of this but some tasks may require specialist contractors, such as organ builders to protect an organ. Work by volunteers will require advance agreement of the church and main contractors. Bell hangers are accustomed to working with volunteers, subject to insurance arrangements being agreed and project specific risk assessments in place.
Undertaking the Work # Video to be inserted here
A short video taken at the start of the Eastnor bells project, in Herefordshire.
The central phase in the project is usually the period during which contractors and volunteers arrive and undertake their work, with a quantities of material and equipment. It will be both exciting as changes take place but also will need careful coordination! Additional items may be required at precise times, and some will require secure storage until used.
At the outset, each contractor will be largely unfamiliar with the location so will need to be assisted with all the formalities (procedures, safety, security etc) and practicalities (toilets, eating and changing facilities etc). It is very easy for clashes to occur even with the best planning so it is essential that the project leader is available to resolve matters as they arise. Not having something or someone available at the right time and place is also likely; alternative arrangements will often have to be made.
Any alteration inevitably means that there are consequences on other activities – being able to notify those concerned and revise all the arrangements can be a challenge!
Delays and unexpected challenges will occur and need to be resolved. A mobile phone and good contacts list will be invaluable but only if there is a phone signal in the tower! Also remember to document any changes agreed with all parties concerned so that everyone is very clear.

Blessing and Dedication # It is customary for the Bishop or other senior church representative to bless the bells, if possible while they are still visible in the church or church yard before being lifted into the tower. This may be at a special service or as part of another church service or ringing event. Often the precise time within the project plan will not be known until relatively late so organisation may be quite complicated.
Alternatively, the re-dedication may be after the bells have been rehung and perhaps rung open (i.e. audibly) for the first time. A video link from the bell chamber to the church can be used so that the bells are visible on a screen during the service. The bells are normally not be rung (other than for basic testing) before the dedication service. Bells are at risk of theft while not hung in the tower so additional security arrangements may be required.
Recommissioning # Plans should set out when and how the bells will be recommissioned. The first ringing after the bells are installed and functioning will usually be by an experienced band who can assist in assessing the new installation with the bell hangers. The acceptance criteria should be set out in the project plans. Ensure that all work activities are completed before each contract is signed off as complete and money paid.
Link to contract terms chapter
Completion, First Ringing and Reporting # Once all work is completed satisfactorily, the tower should be cleaned throughout and items in routine use replaced – chairs, tables, etc. This is an opportunity to clean, restore or replace used items and install additional items to update the facilities available.
Some funders and supporters request reports or evidence that work is complete and these should be supplied stating that they fulfil this requirement. For example, a “Certificate of Practical Completion” must be recorded on the Church of England website.
The project leader should “tidy up” files and records then archive material after an appropriate interval.
It is wise to agree early in the project who and when the first quarter peal and peal are to be rung. This avoids pre-emptive moves by other enthusiastic ringers. Invite ringers who have contributed a lot to the project whether practically, financially or in other ways. Also consider ringers who have had a long association with the tower, even if no longer active locally.
Warning neighbours in advance of ringing recommencing will help avoid complaints and can be an opportunity to recruit new recruits.
Snagging # The contract terms should set out how and by when remedial work will be completed. The project leader should note points that arise and report them to the contractor concerned as soon as possible.
And last but not least - Celebrate!
