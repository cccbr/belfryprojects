Setting out what is to be done in the contract is critical. This defines (a) what is to be done by contractor(s) and (b) the expected outcome of the project. Once the contract is placed, changes may be difficult to make, whether for reasons of practicality or cost. The outcomes of bell projects are normally expected to last for a very long time, decades if not centuries, so it is essential to make sure that the contract is comprehensive and accurate.

This chapter sets out general advice on drawing up a request for quotation, which will then lead to a contract; an [annexe](../070-contract-specification/technical-options/) to this chapter covers technical options which you may need to consider in tailoring your specification to your particular situation.

## Before You Start

{{< hint info >}}
We use the term ‘**Tower Authority**’ here to refer to the churchwardens and Parochial Church Council for towers within the Church of England and to their equivalents in other jurisdictions.
{{< /hint >}}

You must be certain that the **Tower Authority** and the ringers understand and accept what is proposed to be achieved. This will be based on your [scoping of the project](../020-scoping-project/) and the [specialist advice](../030-specialist-advice/) you have obtained, including outline estimates of the likely cost.

There may well be different opinions and expectations. The **Tower Authority** often have cost uppermost in their minds, particularly if their experience and knowledge of bells and bellringing is limited. They may also anticipate other higher priority projects. The ringers may argue that a more comprehensive and expensive project may be more cost effective and bring additional benefits for the medium and longer term – although they will need not to be carried away by the thought of lovely new ring of bells!

A proper understanding can only be obtained by trust and openness on all sides.

## Requesting Quotations

The formal **Client** for the work is the **Tower Authority** so requests for quotations must be placed by them. The ringers will make a significant contribution to drawing up those quotation requests. The **Contractor** will be a bell hanger or bell foundry – see [Specialist Services](../115-specialists/) but note that the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers does not endorse or recommend specific companies.

Points to be included in the request for quotation are given below. You may need to include other technical points as described in the [annexe](../070-contract-specification/technical-options/).

### General points

The **Tower Authority** may expect to ask for more than one equivalent quote. It should be recognised, however, that the number of bell hangers (**Contractors**) is very limited and there may be clear reasons why one company will be preferred. For example, the company may have cast and installed the bells and still have the original design and specifications, even decades or a century or more later!

{{< hint danger >}}
Competitive quotations can be misleading for a variety of reasons and this is the reason for ensuring that the contract specifies the work completely. If you simply ask for the bells to be rehung, one contractor might offer cast-iron headstocks while another offers fabricated steel; one may offer a new frame using traditional cast-iron sideframes while another offers a fully fabricated steel frame, and yet another offers to repair the old frame. One offer may be the best solution and another the cheapest but you should not be in the position of having to judge when the quotations are finally before you – and the contractors should not be put in the position of having to waste time guessing what you want.
{{< /hint >}}

The quotation should outline the requirements and expectations, perhaps with options. If the terms are too prescriptive then this may constrain the **Contractor**. Conversely, not being specific enough (for example, simply asking for the condition of the bells to be improved) may make it difficult to compare the specifications and quotes received, and ultimately to assess whether the **Contractor** has fulfilled the contract in accordance with the specifications. 

Parts of the work may include items not part of the bell installation – masonry work on the tower or work related to access, for example. Possible examples are discussed in more detail in the [annexe](../070-contract-specification/technical-options/). This will require the use of **sub-contractors**. It is usually clearer and lower risk for the contract to be with the bell hanging company (the Main **Contractor**). They then place any subsidiary contracts necessary for aspects of the work that will be required but do not provide themselves.

### Programme

The quotation request will set the expected date of completion and clearly define the expected condition at that point. The **Contractor** will confirm this or suggest an alternative. The **Contractor** may also offer a programme showing the major phases of the work.

The **Contractor** will identify steps to be taken to maintain the programme in the event of unexpected delays and how contract amendments are to be agreed.

### Financial

The **Contractor** will provide an overall cost for the work possibly including part-payments at specific points. The progress at those points will be clearly defined and subject to checking by the **Client**.

The quotation request may define what payment is retained for snagging (the US term is "completing the punch list") and for how long. The **Contractor** will agree to this or offer an alternative.

The **Contractor** may include a follow-up inspection at some interval after completion. The details and cost of this will be given.

The **Contractor** will state what guarantee is offered and against what circumstances.
