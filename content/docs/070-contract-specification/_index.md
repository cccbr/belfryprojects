Setting out what is to be done in the contract is critical. This defines (a) what is to be done by contractor(s) and (b) the expected outcome of the project. Once the contract is placed, changes may be difficult to make, whether for reasons of practicality or cost. The outcomes of bell projects are normally expected to last for a very long time, decades if not centuries, so it is essential to make sure that the contract is comprehensive and accurate.

This chapter sets out general advice on drawing up a request for quotation, which will then lead to a contract; an [annexe](../070-contract-specification/technical-options/) to this chapter covers technical options which you may need to consider in tailoring your specification to your particular situation.

## Before You Start

{{< hint info >}}
We use the term ‘**Tower Authority**’ here to refer to the churchwardens and Parochial Church Council for towers within the Church of England and to their equivalents in other jurisdictions.
{{< /hint >}}

You must be certain that the **Tower Authority** and the ringers understand and accept what is proposed to be achieved. This will be based on your [scoping of the project](../020-scoping-project/) and the [specialist advice](../030-specialist-advice/) you have obtained, including outline estimates of the likely cost.

There may well be different opinions and expectations. The **Tower Authority** often have cost uppermost in their minds, particularly if their experience and knowledge of bells and bellringing is limited. They may also anticipate other higher priority projects. The ringers may argue that a more comprehensive and expensive project may be more cost effective and bring additional benefits for the medium and longer term – although they will need not to be carried away by the thought of lovely new ring of bells!

A proper understanding can only be obtained by trust and openness on all sides.
