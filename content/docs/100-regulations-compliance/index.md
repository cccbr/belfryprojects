# Regulations & Compliance Matters

UNDER CONSTRUCTION

{{<hint danger>}}
During a bell project, various regulations, standards, policies and practices will be encountered. Some of these will be managed by suppliers and contractors but ringers and tower authorities should be aware of the implications as failure to observe them can have serious repercussions.
{{<\hint>}}
 
Requirements related to towers within the Church of England and other jurisdictions
 are given in a [companion document](https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/020-permissions/#formal-requirements) and further requirements related to Health & Safety, Construction Design & Management and Insurance are covered below.
 
## Church Policies and Practices 
 
Each church will have its own policies and practices but these are unlikely to encompass all the circumstances that will be encountered during a major programme of work in the tower. These should therefore be reviewed during planning and suitable arrangements made that will be applicable for the various stages of the project proposed.  It is likely that specific risk assessments will be required for the project. The tower authorities remain responsible for ensuring that appropriate practices are adopted. Contractors will have their own practices for complying with regulations, and specific arrangements must be made for volunteers who may assist.
 
## General Considerations

### Emergency arrangements

 -	While work is underway, there must always be at least 1 volunteer on site who knows the tower and church well
 -	At the start of work, and when different people arrive, every individual must be briefed fully
 -	A record of who is on site during the work must be maintained, with time and date of arrival and departure for each person
 -	Access to basic first aid equipment and accident record book must be available at all times
 -	Battery powered lighting should be available in case of power failure
 -	Contractors and volunteers must know how to contact emergency services and be able to advise them clearly of the building location
 -	A reliable means of communication should be maintained between individuals working on site and those who may need to contact them. Mobile phones may not be adequate if signal strength is poor
