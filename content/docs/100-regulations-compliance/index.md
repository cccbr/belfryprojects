# Regulations & Compliance Matters

UNDER CONSTRUCTION

{{<hint danger>}}
During a bell project, various regulations, standards, policies and practices will be encountered. Some of these will be managed by suppliers and contractors but ringers and tower authorities should be aware of the implications as failure to observe them can have serious repercussions.
{{</hint>}}
 
Requirements related to towers within the Church of England and other jurisdictions
 are given in a [companion document](https://belfryupkeep.cccbr.org.uk/docs/020-permissions/#formal-requirements) and further requirements related to Health & Safety, Construction Design & Management and Insurance are covered below.
 
## Church Policies and Practices 
 
Each church will have its own policies and practices but these are unlikely to encompass all the circumstances that will be encountered during a major programme of work in the tower. These should therefore be reviewed during planning and suitable arrangements made that will be applicable for the various stages of the project proposed.  It is likely that specific risk assessments will be required for the project. The tower authorities remain responsible for ensuring that appropriate practices are adopted. Contractors will have their own practices for complying with regulations, and specific arrangements must be made for volunteers who may assist.
 
## General Considerations

### Emergency arrangements

 -	While work is underway, there must always be at least 1 volunteer on site who knows the tower and church well
 -	At the start of work, and when different people arrive, every individual must be briefed fully
 -	A record of who is on site during the work must be maintained, with time and date of arrival and departure for each person
 -	Access to basic first aid equipment and accident record book must be available at all times
 -	Battery powered lighting should be available in case of power failure
 -	Contractors and volunteers must know how to contact emergency services and be able to advise them clearly of the building location
 -	A reliable means of communication should be maintained between individuals working on site and those who may need to contact them. Mobile phones may not be adequate if signal strength is poor

### CDM (Construction Design and Management) Regulations 2015

{{<hint warning>}}
This section has been prepared in conjunction with [Safe Projects Ltd](http://safeprojects.co.uk).
{{</hint>}}
 
The Construction (Design & Management) Regulations 2015 (known as CDM 2015) are the main set of regulations for managing the health, safety and welfare of construction projects. CDM is a UK law that applies to **all building and construction work** and includes **new build, demolition, refurbishment, extensions, conversions, repair and maintenance**. The full text of the law may be seen [here](https://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/51/contents/made ).

Work to churches is governed by these Regulations and work to bells, whether major rehangs or minor maintenance work by contractors, comes within its remit.

The great majority of ringers will not encounter CDM, but those that are involved with bell restoration work should be aware this law exists; and if the PCC for which the work is being undertaken knows nothing about it, they should be informed, as they too, are involved. 

The Regulations assign responsibilities to various duty holders, which are: Client, Designer, Principal Designer and Principal Contractor. The PCC will be the Client in most cases, the Designer will be the person or company who formulates the design of the work (for example, replacement bell frames, new floors, etc), and where there is more than one contractor, the Principal Contractor will, in most cases, be the bell hanging company that is to undertake the work.

These roles have lawful responsibilities, each duty holder having responsibility for co-ordinating the work of other duty holders (for example, sub-contractors) undertaking similar but lesser roles in the project. PCCs are normally advised by the professional designer (for example, the Church Architect), who is managing the project for them - but this is rarely the case for bell-related projects, as most do not include the Architect. This might imply CDM does not apply to bell projects – it does – but many projects are short term on site and therefore do not come within the requirement to notify the project to the Health & Safety Executive (HSE).

The requirement to notify the HSE of a project becomes necessary if the construction work on site is scheduled to:
 - last longer than 30 working days and have more than 20 workers working simultaneously at any point in the project or 
 - exceed 500 person days.

It is only major bell projects that exceed these parameters (but such projects do exist).

However, while this might seem like a get-out clause for doing nothing, this is not the case. The Regulations demand, regardless of whether a project is notifiable or non-notifiable, that the Client produces a Pre-Construction Information (PCI) document for a project before the site work starts, and in turn the Principal Contractor must provide a Construction Phase Plan (CPP), which is reviewed by the Principal Designer on behalf of the Client. The Regulations require the PCI to be compiled in a way that is appropriate to the scale and complexity of the work being undertaken, in terms of relevant information being passed between the parties prior to the work starting, and thus non-notifiable work will generally include basic information rather than that needed for larger projects.
