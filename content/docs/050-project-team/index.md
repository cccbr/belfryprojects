## Appointing the Project Team 

### Team working

The team should discuss and agree how they intend to operate, share workload and activities, distribute information and maintain records. The team will need to meet periodically to discuss and agree key matters, supplemented by frequent electronic communications. 

As team members get to know each other, they will build a rapport enabling them to work together through the project. There will be high and low points, frustrations and successes; socialising together will help!
