<a class=anchor href=#a-plan-to-go-from-this>#</a></h2><p>Picture here</p><p>As a project takes shape there may be enthusiasm to make progress, particularly start raising money. However, it is advisable to plan the project, considering in some detail <strong>what</strong> has to be done <strong>when</strong>, <strong>how</strong>, by <strong>whom</strong>, with what <strong>resources</strong> first. The plan will ideally run from the earliest discussions through to project completion. Careful planning should reduce the overall duration, save money and make sure that the whole project runs smoothly and meets its aims.</p><blockquote class="book-hint warning">Asking <em>who</em>, <em>what</em>, <em>when</em>, <em>where</em>, <em>why</em>, <em>how</em>, are useful prompts at every stage!</blockquote><p>There is a wide range of material available about planning and running projects. Look for basic guides online and in books (public libraries and bookstalls at larger stations may stock some). A focus on charities and the voluntary sector is most likely to be helpful for bell projects. There is no “right” way to manage a project so this guidance should be adjusted to fit the specific project.</p><p>A particularly comprehensive set of information about church projects is <a href=https://www.hereford.anglican.org/parish-support/community-partnership/crossing-the-threshold-toolkit/>here</a>.</p><h2 id=scheduling-activities>Scheduling activities
<a class=anchor href=#scheduling-activities>#</a></h2><p>The project leader will usually consider the project in stages, with each stage reaching a logical point, for example:<br><em>Scoping the project - concept definition and information gathering</em>
<em>Requesting permission and detailed planning</em>
<em>Selecting contractors and placing contracts</em>
<em>Undertaking the work off site and on site</em>
<em>Completion and close down</em></p><p>Key dates, activities, their durations and milestones should be planned in conjunction with those involved, i.e. stakeholders, contractors and suppliers.</p><p>Much of the detailed work in each stage will be managed by various contractors, but coordinating their activities is a key role of the project leader. Not every activity needs to be sequential and time will be saved if activities are accomplished in parallel whenever possible.</p><p>Be realistic when planning the timetable, not optimistic, as approvals and tasks often take longer than anticipated. At every stage consider the risks and include contingencies to prevent the whole project timescale drifting. The risk is that when time is short, people and activities may be rushed, so accidents and errors may increase. But leaving time for contingencies is not an excuse for poor planning.</p><p>Identify clearly the key dates that have to be fixed. For example, a decision making committee may only meet once a quarter, so find out when their meetings will be held, when they need information to be submitted, and note these in the plan.</p><p>Plan meetings with stakeholders, contractors and suppliers. While some meetings may now be virtual, face to face meetings are still very effective and often enable better personal interaction, especially in the early stages of a project. Meetings help to keep everyone up to date with progress and also offer the opportunity to ask questions. If on site, then progress will be much more
apparent.</p><p>Watch what interdependencies there may between various activities;changes in the timing of one activity will affect others that follow.For example, specific equipment and materials will be required at precise times, with some requiring large areas for storage and security until used.</p><p>Careful consideration of phasing may enable money to be saved; for example, can the period during whichitems are hiredbe minimised, to reduce hire costs?</p><p>For every activity in the plan, consider carefully who else needs to be involved and what else will be needed. Talking through each activity with members of the project team may expose key points that are easily overlooked yet may be critical and time consuming. When and how will reports be required for the PCC, funders and other stakeholders–verbal, written, electronic / on paper? Reports at specific times may be essential for funders so should not be missed! Adding them to the plan, with time allocated for preparation, may take a few minutes, but can save problems and potentiallyloss of income.</p><p>Some grant awarding bodies require reports, data and other actionsboth during and after the project is complete, some even a few years after the project has been finished. Plan how this will be achieved, even as team members change and show how that data and information will be collected as the project proceeds.</p><p>How will progress, changes to the plan or changes of approach be notified to others and recorded? This is all part of good communication–whether by phone, email or electronic tools. It is easy to overlook people who may wish or need to be informed, so setting up specific mailing lists is a wise and efficient way of working.</p><p>At the end of the project, leave time to complete all the formalities and tidy up. There may be additional correspondence to be completed so these must be added to records as they are archived for future reference.</p><p>Lack of planning can lead to what are described as “Unforseen consequences” but they may be the result of poor planning! Ultimately, project management ensures that everything happens, when and how it should!</p><h2 id=project-management-tools>Project Management tools
<a class=anchor href=#project-management-tools>#</a></h2><p>It is advisable for the project leader to set up systematic ways of managing the project. Comprehensive software packages are available, some very expensive, others freely available, but these are not necessary. It is more important for all those involved to be able to access information and use it. The normal cautions apply if free software is used.</p><h2 id=calendar>Calendar
<a class=anchor href=#calendar>#</a></h2><p>A calendar is a good way of showing the start and end dates of activities in each stage, along with specific milestones (GLOSSARY ***), deadlines and events highlighted. Larger projects involving other work in the church are likely to be divided into major phases, only one of which may directly concern the bells.</p><hr><blockquote class="book-hint info"><strong><a href=../030-specialist-advice/>Previous Chapter</a></strong> - <strong><a href=../050-project-team/>Next Chapter</a></strong></blockquote><hr><h2 id=disclaimer>Disclaimer
