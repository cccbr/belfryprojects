Ringing bells full circle is not just a church activity; it is part of our national heritage. A four hundred year old tradition, it offers challenges and requires skills which most people are able to achieve. Whilst it is based at the parish church and is a part of the worshipping Christian community, a band of ringers is part of the social life of the parish.</description></item><item><title>Scoping the Project</title><link>https://belfryprojects.cccbr.org.uk/docs/020-scoping-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://belfryprojects.cccbr.org.uk/docs/020-scoping-project/</guid><description>Scoping the Project # A bell project may start as the seed of an idea or it may already have been discussed in a committee such as the Parochial Church Council (PCC). This chapter suggests how to develop the initial ideas so that other people may become involved and start to appreciate what may be achieved. This will help the project come to a successful completion. No two projects will be the same so these notes offer guidance that may be considered rather than a step by step guide.</description></item><item><title>Getting Specialist Advice</title><link>https://belfryprojects.cccbr.org.uk/docs/030-specialist-advice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://belfryprojects.cccbr.org.uk/docs/030-specialist-advice/</guid><description>Getting Specialist Advice # UNDER CONSTRUCTION

As a project takes shape there may be enthusiasm to make progress, particularly start raising money. However, it is advisable to plan the project, considering in some detail what has to be done when, how, by whom, with what resources first. The plan will ideally run from the earliest discussions through to project completion. Careful planning should reduce the overall duration, save money and make sure that the whole project runs smoothly and meets its aims.</description></item><item><title>Project Team</title><link>https://belfryprojects.cccbr.org.uk/docs/050-project-team/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://belfryprojects.cccbr.org.uk/docs/050-project-team/</guid><description>Project Team # UNDER CONSTRUCTION
