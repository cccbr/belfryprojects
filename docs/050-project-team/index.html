<a class=anchor href=#appointing-the-project-team>#</a></h2><h3 id=project-leader>Project Leader
<a class=anchor href=#project-leader>#</a></h3><p>The tower authority should appoint a project leader. Previous experience of managing projects may be helpful whether professionally or voluntarily but is not essential. Interest, a logical approach plus time available are probably most important.</p><p>Importantly, the leader should be willing to work with others whether volunteers, contractors, those consulted and giving advice, and other stakeholders. The leader need not to be “the best ringer”, tower captain or steeple keeper, but should have some knowledge of ringing and bell installations.</p><p>The leader’s terms of appointment should be agreed ideally in writing, outlining the scope of their responsibilities, what is to be achieved, timescales and any constraints.</p><h3 id=team-members>Team Members
<a class=anchor href=#team-members>#</a></h3><p>The leader should have the authority to appoint a small team, after consultation with the tower authorities, to assist with various aspects of the project. Team members may be allocated a specific role such as Project Secretary or Treasurer, consistent with their skills, interests and time available. What they agree to do should be set out in writing. Importantly, the team should be able to provide continuity if key individuals are unavailable.</p><p>Offers of help should be valued and accepted but not every volunteer needs to be a full team member, for example, someone may be willing to contribute to a certain activity or for a certain period but not involved otherwise.</p><p>Team members need not all be bell ringers; they may be able to contribute in other ways and will certainly gain new experiences. Volunteers may subsequently become involved in church activities and ringing, having not been involved previously. Young people helping will learn a lot and potentially help their careers! For those under 18, parental consent is essential. (Link to safeguarding ***)</p><h3 id=team-working>Team Working
<a class=anchor href=#team-working>#</a></h3><p>The team should discuss and agree how they intend to operate, share workload and activities, distribute information and maintain records. The team will need to meet periodically to discuss and agree key matters, supplemented by frequent electronic communications.</p><p>As team members get to know each other, they will build a rapport enabling them to work together through the project. There will be high and low points, frustrations and successes; socialising together will help!</p><h3 id=team-members-and-roles>Team Members and Roles
<a class=anchor href=#team-members-and-roles>#</a></h3><p>The following are examples of roles that may be required. Note that several roles may be combined or may not be necessary, depending on the scale of the project and interests of those involved.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Role</th><th>Character</th><th>Responsibilities</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><th>Project Champion</th><td>Visionary, charismatic champion for the project, key influencer, well connected, spokesman</td><td>High profile engagement with local dignitaries, official bodies</td></tr><tr><th>Project Leader</th><td>Determination, completer finisher, planner, team worker, eye for detail</td><td><ul><li>Coordinate whole project</li><li>Prepare the project plan and schedule - what happends when, who and how</li><li>Finalise and proof read contracts prior to sign off</li><li>Reschedule and record changes, keep everyone informed</li><li>Identify, log and review risks, update them appropriately</li><li>Report to church authorities at agreed intervals</li></ul></td></tr><tr><th>Bell and Ringing Advisor / Tower captain (may be two people)</th><td>Bell ringer, engineer, technical knowledge, contract insights</td><td><ul><li>Provide knowledge and advice on aspects relating to bells and ringing</li><li>Plan final ring on existing bells</li><li>Plan first ringing on installed bells</li><li>Maintain existing band of ringers while tower is inaccessible</li></ul></td></tr><tr><th>Project Treasurer</th><td><ul><li>Finance / accountancy knowledge</li><li>VAT, gift aid</li><li>Listed places of worship exemption</li></ul></td><td><ul><li>Prepare budget: income, expenditure, contingency</li><li>Obtain approvals for expenditure</li><li>Monitor expenditure, compare with budget and income</li><li>Collect grants</li></ul></td></tr><tr><th>Grant Writer</th><td>Good writing / language skills, meets deadlines</td><td><ul><li>Identify grant opportunities</li><li>Research requirements</li><li>Prepare grant applications</li><li>Report to grant awarding bodies</li></ul></td></tr><tr><th>Fund Raising Lead</th><td>Local and wider knowledge of opportunities</td><td><ul><li>Establish fund raising plan and campaign</li><li>Engage support of fund raisers</li><li>Lead preparation of fund raising materials</li><li>Prioritise and coordinate fund raising events</li></ul></td></tr><tr><th>Project Secretary</th><td>Administrator, attention to details</td><td><ul><li>Coordinate, collate and submit Faculty documents</li><li>Apply for and manage formal permissions with appropriate authorities</li><li>Formal meeting minutes and action follow up</li><li>Records management</li></ul></td></tr><tr><th>Stakeholder relations Lead / Public Relations</th><td>Good communicator, designer, artist, author, social media and web user, charismatic, flair, imagination</td><td><ul><li>Frequent formal updates for PCC and church authorities</li><li>Informative updates for congregation, church magazine, notice boards</li><li>Press releases</li><li>Fliers and leaflets</li><li>Display boards</li><li>Photographic record</li><li>Maintain an interesting blog</li><li>Set up and maintain project website</li></ul></td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=team-supporters>Team supporters
<a class=anchor href=#team-supporters>#</a></h2><p>Supportive volunteers, whether from the church or local community, may offer a wide range of skills and experience. If helping professional contractors such as bell hangers, then this must be agreed in advance with the companies concerned and the volunteers must follow guidance and instructions from the relevant professionals. Bell hangers may agree as part of the contract to reduce the price of the work if volunteers agree to help with aspects of the work.</p><p>Young people under 18 (with parental consent in accordance with safeguarding requirements LINK***) can be encouraged to assist according to their age, maturity and interests. They will have a great experience, learn a little about bell installations, and contribute enthusiastically. Even younger children enjoy helping, for example, carrying just small items from a van to the church door.</p><p>Some people will be technically minded, but many with other skills will contribute:</p><ul><li>IT, computing – website, blog, project tools, presentations, brochure layout</li><li>historians – a history of the bells, past ringers, ringing events in the context of the local town or village locations</li><li>craftspeople and tradesmen – painting, woodwork, metal work associated with the project, with contractors or small additional items of use, or for sale. Perhaps using items recycled from items removed from the tower as part of the project</li><li>musicians – the music of bell ringing, handbells in concerts, schools, fund raising events</li><li>artists and designers – artwork for displays, presentations posters, grant applications, website, brochure</li><li>photographers – record of project, imagery for website, blog</li><li>building owners – venues, parking for events</li><li>chefs, caterers - events and fund raising</li><li>volunteer labour - working under guidance of the professional contractors, clearing items, lifting, carrying, moving, sweeping and cleaning</li></ul><p>…… there is potential in everyone!</p><p>Volunteers may be able to assist with:</p><ul><li>Donation or loan at no or reduced cost - equipment, tools, scaffold, fork lifts</li><li>Heavy lift and transport of bells to and from bell hangers premises</li><li>Dismantling components and removing them from the tower</li><li>Cleaning, preparation and finishing in the tower</li><li>Carrying materials and components back into the tower</li><li>Frame assembly and painting</li><li>Installing fittings and components</li><li>Installing new flooring, ceiling, furniture, wiring</li><li>Painting, decorating ringing room and other space</li><li>Installing external sound control and ensuring good internal acoustics</li><li>Provision of overnight accommodation, washing and changing facilities, refreshments</li><li>Hosting visitors, running errands</li></ul><p><img src=project-team_fig-1.jpg alt="Recognition of project team"></p><p><em>Figure 1: Recognition for the project team at Horton Kirby, Kent</em></p><h2 id=image-credits>Image Credits
