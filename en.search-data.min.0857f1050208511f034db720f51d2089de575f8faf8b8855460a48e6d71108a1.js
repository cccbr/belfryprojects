Ringing bells full circle is not just a church activity; it is part of our national heritage. A four hundred year old tradition, it offers challenges and requires skills which most people are able to achieve. Whilst it is based at the parish church and is a part of the worshipping Christian community, a band of ringers is part of the social life of the parish. It brings together people of all ages from all walks of life to participate in an absorbing and fascinating hobby.
A ring of bells will last for many years without major expense, requiring only routine checks and minor maintenance which can be carried out by a suitable experienced Steeple Keeper. Guidance on this can be found in a companion document. In time, however, more major work may be necessary. This will require specialists and contractors, and this document provides advice about how to plan and manage a project involving tower bells and their installation. This is not a technical manual for doing any of the work being considered, even though local volunteers may assist professional bell hangers and other contractors with some of the work.
Figure 1: Refurbished bells delivered back to the church ready for rehanging
Figure 1 gives a taste of what might be involved. The ring of 6 bells at Elkstone, Gloucestershire, were taken out by a bell hanger (with volunteer help). They were retuned and new fittings added. Here they are returned to the church ready for rehanging. Two of these bells were cast in 1657.
For Non-Ringers # Anyone familiar with bell ringing can skip this section but, recognising that this document may be read by non-ringers, the following may be helpful. Further information is given on the website of the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers. A ring of bells installed for full circle change ringing usually comprises between 5 and 12 bells, each weighing several cwt to a ton or more (200kg – 1000kg). The total weight of the bells alone in a tower is therefore considerable. When installed in a tower, the bells together form an integral part of a large musical instrument. Each bell is rung by one ringer in a band.
The sound is not in the form of tunes as from most other musical instruments, but as sequences of mathematical “changes”. Each bell strikes just once as it is rotated one way through a full circle then back again. The installation in the tower therefore has to be substantial enough to withstand the forces imposed as the bells are rotated.
Bell ringers are members of the local community as bells are rung not just for church events but also to mark local, national and even international occasions. Change ringing has a history of over four hundred years. It offers challenges and requires both physical and mental skills, with insights into complex mathematics, history, engineering, technology, communities and geography. Ringing brings together people of all age groups and with diverse interests – history, travel, mathematics, engineering and – increasingly – computing, to name but a few.
The use of specialist jargon in these notes will be limited but some is unavoidable; this is where ringers and specialists will need to assist.
Ownership of the Bells # With the exception of a few private rings, the ringers do not ‘own’ the bells. About 90% of bells hung for full-circle ringing are in hung in Church of England churches. Within the Church of England those responsible for the tower and bells are usually the Churchwardens and the Parochial Church Council (PCC). The legal ownership of the bells is vested in the Churchwardens. The PCC has a duty for the use, maintenance and insurance of the bells.
In other towers, and other jurisdictions, there will usually be what we will term an Authorising Body that will have a legal responsibility for the tower and its contents. In such cases, different policies and procedures may have to be adopted and arrangements and permissions must be obtained from the appropriate authorities. Further details are given in the Belfry Upkeep document.
TOP TIP The Church (usually) owns the tower and bells, not the ringers Scope of this Document # Who may wish to read it # Bell ringers considering a restoration project for the bells that they ring. The owner or people responsible for a bell tower - such as church or cathedral clergy, other church workers and volunteers, perhaps with little knowledge of bells and ringing. Third parties with related interests. It will be the Authorising Body and local bell ringers who are most likely to consider the work required and how it can be achieved. For the leader of the project, some knowledge of bell ringing and some engineering or technical knowledge will be helpful, as will experience of organising activities. Planning and undertaking a bell project may seem daunting as few people will have done anything similar before, but a leader with a small team will enjoy working together to achieve a successful outcome.
How the document may help # There are several circumstances which may result in the need for a project involving a bell installation:
The bells have become difficult to ring safely and reliably, limiting the ringing and, more importantly, making it difficult to teach new ringers. A church with no bells hung for full circle ringing may wish to install a full ring as a witness to the life of the church. There may be a wish to augment the number of existing bells. This provides more variety in the ringing (provided, of course, that the tower can raise a capable band). More rarely there may be an ambitious project to install new bells in an existing tower or even in a new purpose designed and constructed tower, as shown in Figure 2. Figure 2: Church of the Transfiguration, Orleans, MA 02653 USA – a new church building dedicated in 2000, bells installed 2010
Each project will be unique, often in a historic building, requiring design work, traditional craft skills, as well as the use of appropriate equipment, tools and facilities. Specialist advice will be required. There are also permissions and regulations that need to be considered.
There will be concern about the likely expense. However, fund raising for bell projects is often very successful, with considerable sums raised by a wide variety of means.
Fund raising and the project itself can also become a focus and stimulus for not just those immediately involved but many other groups of people locally and further afield.
Bells not hung for change ringing # Figure 3: : Single bell on The Old Town Hall, Denbigh
Not all bells are hung for full circle change ringing. Some may be a carillon with many bells, a chime of just a few bells, or a single bell, as shown in Figure 3. The technical arrangements of these installations will be different, less demanding structurally for some, but planning and implementing a project will be similar in many respects.
Other Work in Bell Towers # Usually with the best intentions, some churches may propose work that could adversely affect the installation or ringing of the bells. Ringers should be aware of this. Occasionally, work is proposed in a tower or church that could affect the bells, their installation or ringing of the bells, even though the main focus of the work is not the bell installation itself. For example, there may be plans to create meeting rooms, kitchen or toilet facilities in the building. Such changes may affect the access to the spaces required by the bell ringers as they ring the bells, and the access to the bell chamber. Even if only rarely required, it must be possible to access and even remove the bells from tower and this is usually only via trap doors in all the floors and ceilings from ground level to the bell chamber.
There are examples of towers where rings of bells are now unusable and inaccessible in towers. For example, a former church is now a pub and the bells are not accessible for ringing. Another church is still open for worship but the tower has been converted to offices with no public access to the bells which remain in situ, and the former ringing room contains equipment. It is therefore essential that experienced bell ringers contribute advice to make sure that the alterations will not adversely affect routine access and use of the ringing room, the bell chamber or ringing in any way. Bell ringers may also be able to suggest how the project may offer potential for improvements to the ringing environment.
The best protection against this happening is for the ringers to maintain close liaison with their tower Authorising Body, contributing to any proposals and providing information on the needs of the ringers and the bell installation. Unfortunately, this cannot be the case where the tower has no ringers. This is a difficult situation but ringers at neighbouring towers, with help from the local Guild or Association, may be able to assist.

`}),e.add({id:1,href:"/docs/020-scoping-project/",title:"Scoping the Project",section:"Docs",content:` Scoping the Project # Of the over 7000 rings of bells in the world, around 90% are within the jurisdiction of the Church of England (CoE). We will use terms such as &lsquo;incumbent&rsquo;, &lsquo;church wardens&rsquo; and &lsquo;Parochial Church Council (PCC)&rsquo; in this document. We trust you can translate these into the equivalent terms in other jurisdictions. A bell project may start as the seed of an idea or it may already have been discussed in a committee such as the Parochial Church Council (PCC). This chapter suggests how to develop the initial ideas so that other people may become involved and start to appreciate what may be achieved. This will help the project come to a successful completion. No two projects will be the same so these notes offer guidance that may be considered rather than a step by step guide.
This document contains a large amount of (we hope) relevant and useful material. This downloadable PDF file may be a useful introduction, perhaps when discussing a project with non-ringers. Inception and Generation of Initial Ideas # Whose idea is it? # A project involving tower bells may be proposed by one of several individuals or groups. It may be bell ringers but others such as the incumbent, church members or local parishioners interested in the tower and bells may also have suggestions. They will have various motivations depending on their interests and expectations, views and opinions.
Preliminary formalities # Regardless of who suggested the project, ideas should be discussed informally at an early stage with the tower authority, normally the church wardens and PCC for towers within the Church of England. Some Incumbents, church wardens and PCC members will not be familiar with change ringing so it is advisable for ringers to help them understand what is involved in the activity, particularly if there are no bells in the tower or they have not been rung recently. A good way to help people understand is to visit the tower to see any existing installation along with a demonstration of change ringing by the ringers, if it is safe to do so. A visit to other towers to see experienced ringers in action will often be helpful and ringers are usually very willing to demonstrate what is involved - ringing encompasses much more than just pulling a rope or even switching on a switch! Ringers will also offer explanations of the mathematics, engineering, travel, history and team-work that ringing offers.
The tower authority should appoint a project leader and may suggest team members to help. At this stage there will not be permission to go ahead with the project itself. Further discussions will be necessary at PCC meetings with decisions recorded formally at various stages in PCC minutes. An initial project team will gather information and ideas, then consider what the project could achieve, the benefits for the short, medium and longer term, and how it may be accomplished.
The team should be open to suggestions. Different people with different experiences and views will bring new ideas that should be considered and included for consideration. Support and help will be needed from many others – it should not be a “vanity project” for one or a few people with vested interests!
Why is the project proposed? # Bell projects may be proposed for various reasons:
improve the mechanical condition of an existing bell installation – often the motivation of change ringers improve safety and the environment for users, including ringers add one or more bells to an existing ring – perhaps the ringers’ idea, but there may be other reasons such as a benevolent donor or legacy for a lasting memorial install a new ring of bells – a tower without any bells? attract and enthuse new ringers, particularly young people – probably as part of a larger campaign in the church make better use of space available and install facilities – toilets, kitchens, meeting rooms, concert venues – a more versatile building welcome new users from the community to the building &hellip; but be cautious! Not everyone will immediately be enthusiastic about the project! Some projects will be highly contentious and it is essential that the needs of ringers are considered alongside those of other users and vice versa. This is particularly important at towers with little or no regular ringing and no local ringers.
TOP TIP: Aim for many benefits for many people for many years! How big will the project be? # Use imagination! Initially, do not worry about practicalities or money – consider what could be done ideally and develop those as the aims. What may be viewed as a large commitment for a small rural parish may be less daunting for a large, high profile parish church or cathedral. No idea is a bad idea, “brainstorm” with others to generate suggestions. It will be easier to attract funds to an ambitious project that meets the aspirations of many, than a small project that satisfies the interests of few. Later it may be necessary to compromise, so separate and develop the ideas later. Remember that the outcomes of bell projects will last for 20, 50, 100 years or more and there will be few opportunities for amendments once the project is complete.
The main focus of the project may be bell related, but a church project may include more extensive work of which the bells are just one part. Although these notes focus on bell projects, bell ringers themselves may benefit from other work that may be included in larger projects. For example, space may be converted to provide more suitable accommodation for a wider cross-section of the local community, with different interests and age groups. Modern designs incorporate level access for wheelchairs and the less mobile, kitchen and toilet facilities (Figure 1) and self-contained meeting rooms of various sizes, that are practical and efficient. For ringers, these may offer facilities for meetings, training and events. a new ringing room or gallery may enable bell ringers in action to be viewed from the body of the church if a suitable glazed screen is incorporated in the design. the ringing room separated from the body of the church will be easier to heat. a shorter rope length may also help ringing if the draught is excessive (a ceiling height of less than about 12 feet (about 4 metres) is not recommended). Figure 1: Extension under construction at Eastnor, Herefordshire, to accommodate disabled toilet, storage and food servery
Consider whether other work should be undertaken at the same time as a bell project. Could scaffold and lifting gear be used for other work around the tower? This may seem more complicated and expensive but for the longer term, it may be more cost-effective overall. What should be done first and what left until later? Remember that work in the tower will inevitably disturb dirt and debris so leave the installation of new and cleaned items until later, if at all possible.
The bell work may be part of a larger programme of work in the church or a more limited project affecting the bells and bell installation alone. Remember that bell installations last for decades and centuries, and there will be few opportunities for major alterations once the project is complete. For a church project, make sure that changes do not limit the scope for further bell related work.

When does it need to be finished? # Is there a date by which the project needs to be completed that will determine the timeline? Can the project be linked with a specific anniversary or event, whether local or national? The Millennium, Royal Jubilee (Figure 2) and Coronation, the end of hostilities during World Wars 1 and 2, and church anniversaries have all been marked by bell projects. Sometimes it is other work that sets the timescale – the demolition of an existing church hall to raise money from a residential development makes alterations in the church a priority.

Considering risks # It is equally important to consider risks that may be encountered at each stage in the project; how will they be monitored and how would they be mitigated if they arose. Considering risks is part of project management.
Specialist advice and information # A lot of advice will be required during the project; information on how and where to obtain specialist advice is offered in the next chapter.
Other supporting information # Information and facts, personalities and stories associated with the bells and ringers will be very useful when writing proposals for grants and raising funds. Information will be available in church archives and diocesan records, as well as a public library, county archives and old copies of local newspapers. Members of local history and archaeology groups may have or be willing to assist in gathering information. Local residents, especially those from families who have been in the area for several generations may have their own memoires and records. Memorials and gravestones may suggest who may be able to help (Figure 3).
Figure 3: Tablet marking the donation of the Victoria Jubilee bells in Great Malvern Priory
Stakeholder views # Even for the smallest project, encourage and involve others – one person cannot think of every possibility. There will be many stakeholders locally and more widely, not all of whom will be known at the start, and some will have views that differ from those more directly involved in the project. The project team should think laterally and take time to “brainstorm” together to identify all possible stakeholders. Invite them to consider and contribute. Ideally identify then contact appropriate named people rather than cold-calling.
Capture any offers of help as there will be many ways in which volunteers will be able to assist later as members and supporters of the project team. Even if people cannot help, they may know others who could have information or who can support. Offers of help may well reduce costs that will be incurred, and those offering will build their own personal experiences or business interests.
Presentation of outline proposals # Once the scope of the project has been developed sufficiently, it will be timely to present the project to more people, to gain their interest and ideas. Prepare information about the project using various formats - as talks and presentations, displays, leaflets, podcasts, videos, sketches, diagrams, models, artefacts etc. Various versions will be required for diverse audiences such as young people and school children, neighbours and local residents, local organisations or companies, etc.
As well as organising special events, take the opportunity to add information to other events and media. For example, parish meetings, church groups and events in the locality. Be imaginative – can historical aspects be presented to primary school children, and scouts and guides? Such events will raise questions and prompt debate – they are all opportunities to recruit potential ringers, encourage support and defuse any concerns. Every event is likely to lead to more ideas and more questions. But be cautious, what may seem to be minor details may stimulate heated debate, such as the colour of a new carpet!
Refine and Improve the Initial Ideas # Once initial ideas have been collected, the incumbent and PCC should discuss the project and agree for it to be planned in detail by a project team. This will still not include permission to go ahead with the work!
The bells and associated installation # This is a summary of the key issues to be addressed. For major projects you should also consult Technical Options, which is an addendum to Contract Specification. Figure 4: A new bell being cast by Meighs &amp; Westleys
If new bells (Figure 4) are proposed, then how many, and of what weights? Is augmentation really needed? Will the outcome facilitate the attraction, training and retention of ringers? How big or strong is the tower structure? Adding 2 bells to a heavier ring of 8 will enable a lighter tuneful 6 to be rung Explore options carefully, without just jumping to conclusions! Does the clock use the same bells, is there a chiming mechanism? Will this be restored or removed as part of the project? What is to be retained, what should be disposed of, what could be added? What of all the component parts can be retained, repaired, reused elsewhere, recycled? Ease of maintenance should be considered in the design of any substantially altered or completely new installation. Traditionally, bell frames were located at the level of the louvres. Depending on the design of your tower, it may be possible to locate a new frame lower in the tower. This may have the advantage of reducing the sound level immediately outside the tower and possibly make the bells sound better at a distance. In particular, it should avoid individual bells ‘shouting out’ at certain positions around the tower. If you plan to replace an historic old frame by a modern one, this also gives you the option of retaining the old frame in place. If you decide to follow this option, there are some points you need to consider:
The old frame must be stabilised to avoid parts falling off onto the new bells. If the frame is historic, you may have to provide access for inspection and recording – remember that you may not have a solid floor below the old frame. You will also need to have access to the louvres, to check and maintain the grills protecting the tower from access by birds, squirrels and other wildlife. Peal Boards # During a restoration project, there may be a need to relocate old peal boards. You may even decide on a new board – perhaps a double one showing the last peal on the old ring and the first after restoration. This will certainly need to be included in the items to be agreed with the tower authority and they must consider whether further permissions are required according to the Church of England Faculty process. Useful advice on this is provided in an article New peal boards and restorations in the 30 June 2023 issue of The Ringing World (p 675). A list of specialists providing peal boards is included in the Specialist Services chapter.
What other improvements should be made? # Before work is underway consider the need for the following:
Variable sound control so that neighbours are not disturbed by ringing Improved access to higher levels of the tower and roof, including to enable tower tours Roof or gutter repairs Addition of safety features (e.g. improved staircase, handrails, steps, walk ways and ladders) Weather and bird protection for the tower Sound management externally (for neighbours) and internally for ringers Security (improved doors and windows, locks, alarms) Electrical supplies, lightning conductor, emergency lighting Renewal and / or treatment of metal and timberwork in tower Removal of debris and clutter, unused items such as pipework and cables As well as ringing the bells, ringers and others will need to access the tower and bells periodically. They will need to check the conditions and undertake routine maintenance, as well as putting on and taking off bell muffles. More rarely, even the bells or larger parts of the installation may need to be removed down through the tower. Access must therefore be left available, from the tower staircase or trap doors.
Other details to support ringing # The opportunity should be seized to create a better environment for recruiting, teaching and retaining new ringers, and engaging with the wider church and local communities
Training aids for bell ringers (“dumb” bells and / or simulators, (for example, as at Worcester Cathedral) Decoration of the ringing room Heating and ventilation for ringers Seating Boxes for ringers to stand on CCTV to show the bells while ringing and the ringers in action (Figure 5) Figure 5: A multi-channel live display in the ringing room of Ledbury tower that shows various locations inside and outside the tower. Other static display material is mounted alongside in the ringing room
Intercom for communication (“the bride has just arrived!”) Video linking to the church, belfry and ringing room Display of bell related items, both historic and to demonstrate ringing (Figure 6) Figure 6: Display of old clappers in Widecombe Church, Devon
Accommodating disabled ringers # Considering the physical efforts required in ringing and the restricted access at many towers, it has often been assumed that it is not possible for a disabled person to ring safely. But public attitudes to disability are changing and examples can be found in the wide variety of sports where athletes, possibly with modified equipment, compete at a high level.
The ways in which disabled ringers can be accommodated in existing towers is discussed in Running a Tower. A major project may offer additional possibilities here – for example, incorporating changes to access and the layout of a ringing room that would be difficult and expensive in an existing structure. This might even be a deciding factor in a decision on whether to re-locate the ringing room to a ground floor.
Practical considerations # Work in a bell tower inevitably disturbs or creates a considerable amount of dust and debris, some accumulated over decades or centuries. Care must be taken to protect other fabric and fittings in the building during the work, especially those that are fragile or delicate. Items such as memorials, lectern, wood and stonework may need covering. For the most sensitive items like the organ, this may be a major exercise - see Figure 7 - and may demand a separate contract from an organ builder.
Figure 7: Protection of the organ at Malvern Priory during the rehanging project
Doorways, floors and staircases may need to be protected when heavy items are being moved and at points where scaffolding is to be erected. External accesses, storage and workspaces will also have to be planned.
For surplus materials and items generated in the course of the project, plan how they will be reused, recycled or their disposal. Some items may be reused as removed from the tower or after being refurbished. Rather than disposing of items, enterprising and creative volunteers may be able turn old timber or metal pieces into souvenirs for sale. Component parts that are no longer serviceable may still be sold and support fund raising. Note that disposal of certain church assets is covered by Faculty Rules.
Fund raising # The overriding concern for many will be how a bell project can be afforded. In all but exceptional cases, there will be a need to raise money, often what will seem to be quite a substantial sum. The question of money needs to be borne in mind while scoping the project but in a balanced way – not too optimistic or too pessimistic. It is likely to be easier to raise the funds for an ambitious, more costly project with wide community benefits than a smaller scale project only likely to support the few local bell ringers. Be brave and hopeful – the money will come.
There are a few grant awarding organisations that specialise in supporting bell related project but the majority of charitable funders now expect any project to benefit a wider group of beneficiaries than just bell ringers or even the church alone.
Potential funders will need to be convinced about who will benefit and how, in the short, medium and longer term. The project needs to be made relevant for a significant part of the local community, interesting and fun! It will be necessary to demonstrate how the work will benefit many people from diverse groups, particularly those who are normally not typically engaged, and last for a long time, years and decades, not just weeks and months.
Once the scale and approximate cost of the project is known, it will be appropriate to launch a fund raising campaign.
Scope creep # While it is appropriate to aim for a project that makes best use of the time and effort that will be devoted to it, be cautious that the scope of the project does not become too ambitious. Play devil’s advocate and challenge carefully additional features that are suggested to ensure that they will add the value anticipated.
TOP TIP: Go far and wide, do lots of research to find unexpected opportunities and potential pitfalls. Ringing and Ringers While the Project is Underway # If there is an existing band of ringers, consider how they will continue to ring while the bells are out of action. They may be able to support ringing at neighbouring towers and this may be the opportunity for them to experience different numbers and weights of bells. Plan how the ringers will keep in contact with each other and the progress of the project, especially if they are unable to ring elsewhere for some reason.
If the tower has few or no ringers, how will a new band be recruited and trained as part of the project? Volunteers from nearby towers may help recruit lapsed ringers and prospective ringers. Willingness, enthusiasm and determination to succeed is required, whether they are regular churchgoers or not. This is covered in the companion document Running a Tower. In addition, The Association of Ringing Teachers supports ringing teachers and recruiting new ringers, and the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers provides some resources for recruiting new ringers.
The most satisfying thing of all is for your new band to ring at the dedication service.
Getting Approval and Permission to go Ahead # Once the scope of the project has been outlined in detail, the Project Leader will finalise the details, and draw up all the documentation. First it will be the tower authorities who will have to give permission for the project to go ahead and they in turn will need to be convinced that all the information required for higher level approvals is available.

`}),e.add({id:2,href:"/docs/030-specialist-advice/",title:"Getting Specialist Advice",section:"Docs",content:` Getting Specialist Advice # It is only with specialist advice that the full scale and scope of a project is likely to be determined. Every tower and ring of bells is unique so advice on the tower and bell installation will have to relate to each project specifically.
As with other major projects, many people will be concerned that they do not know where to start, where to obtain advice or even what advice will be needed. Perversely, it is asking questions and finding information that generates more questions and options! Use multiple sources of information and be open minded at the start – do not limit ideas by preconceived expectations about feasibility, funding or other constraints.
Advice on Bell Installations # If you already have a band of ringers wanting to improve or augment their bells, you should already be in contact with the bell ringing community. This gives you a big head start and much of the information given here may already be familiar to you – although there is always more to learn!
If you have no ringers, maybe no bells in your tower, and perhaps you know little about bell ringing, then you will need to lean heavily on specialist advice. We hope the following will help you.
Local ringers &amp; ringing societies # Neighbouring towers are a valuable first source of information, particularly if you have little or no knowledge of bell installations. They may provide early thoughts on the scope of your project and they can put you in touch with the wider ringing community.
Most ringing societies are affiliated to the Council of Church Bell Ringers (CCCBR). Some societies have an appointed ‘Bell Adviser’ (not to be confused with the Diocesan Bells Adviser) and maybe a network of local bell advisers. Whatever the arrangement, the Society should be able to offer informal advice on various aspects of a project. This may include the condition of an existing bell installation, what may be feasible in a project and possible ways to achieve the outcomes. These advisers will have knowledge of likely contractors with experience and knowledge locally or nationally and will usually offer such advice voluntarily and for no more than out of pocket expenses. Any of these who are also employed in the bell or other relevant trades must, of course declare a conflict of interest.
In some instances, local ringers may offer to help undertake minor maintenance that may improve the condition of the installation, even enable bells to be rung as an interim solution while more major work is planned. This minor work may still require permission before going ahead.
Diocesan Bells Adviser # For towers within the Church of England, the permission for anything other than very minor work will involve a faculty or Archdeacon’s approval. Any such permission will be obtained by your church authority (Church Wardens and PCC) but ringers will make an essential contribution. The application is made through your Diocesan Advisory Committee (DAC). The DAC will have an appointed DAC Bells Adviser who may provide advice informally on the proposed project, usually once the scale and scope are moderately well developed. Their formal role is to advise the Diocesan Advisory Committee, that in turn advises the Chancellor of the Diocese, who will make the ultimate decision on whether the project may go ahead. They may be contacted through the Secretary of the appropriate Diocesan Advisory Committee. Note that they are not permitted to draw up detailed schemes or recommend particular contractors.
Bell Hangers &amp; Founders # At some stage you will need to be in contact with bell hangers (who carry out the installation) and, if new bells are required, bell founders (some companies fulfil both functions).
It would be unusual (but not impossible) for a tower to contact a bell foundry directly, as this will usually be done by the bell hanger. Contact details for such companies are given in Specialist Services.
Companies in the bell trade will provide reports on the condition of any existing bells and the associated installation and provide price estimates for work that they propose. They may suggest other advice needed, such as from structural engineers on the condition of the tower itself:
How an existing ring of bells may be restored by relatively minor repairs to or replacement of old, damaged or worn components More substantial alterations and repairs, perhaps with a new frame to accommodate the addition of one of more new bells A major project to install a new ring of bells in a tower never before used for change ringing While the input from such companies is valuable and essential, there is a view that they may not appreciate your own particular needs and that you should have a clear view of those needs before contacting such companies.
Clocks # If the bells are rung as part of the clock chime as well as ringing bells, then clock companies may need to advise. If an existing clock is manually wound or strikes at night, then consider extending your project to automating the clock mechanism so that manual winding is no longer required, and adding a mechanism so that it can be silenced at night.
Electric winding has a sometimes overlooked advantage over manual winding. With manual winding, a long drop for the weights is needed to avoid frequent winding. With electric winding, the weights drop only a short distance before the mechanism winds them back up. The advantage of this is shown in Figure 1:
Figure 1: A tower clock modified for electrical winding
As usual, this clock is situated in the clock room, or intermediate room, between the ringing room and the bell chamber. When it was manually wound, the wires supporting the weights were routed up into the bell chamber, round two sets of pulleys to drop down in the corner of the clock room and into a chute running down into the ringing room. When fully wound, the weights were in the bell chamber to maximise the drop.
There were two disadvantages: (a) for inspection and repair of pulleys, the clock engineer required access to the bell chamber, with very little room to place the ladder needed to reach the pulleys, and (b) the holes needed to accommodate the weights in the bell chamber and intermediate room floors, plus the weight chute, transmitted bell noise into the ringing room.
Figure 1 shows the installation after conversion to electric winding – the motors (in this case two, for the clock and the hour chime) are shown at A. The weight wires pass over pulleys (B) down to the weights (C). The whole installation is now located within the clock room, simplifying maintenance, and the holes in both floors are sealed, cutting down noise in the ringing room.
Clearly, much of this work was carried out by a church clock specialist.
Contact details for companies working on church clocks are given in Specialist Services.
Electrical # The electrical supplies in a tower for lighting and power may be inadequate or not energy efficient. The project may include upgrading of the supplies and this may be essential to enable contractors to use power tools and work safely with adequate lighting during and after project completion.
Note that the Church of England Faculty Rules limit the contractors who are permitted to work in churches. “For the purposes of Schedule 1 and work to an electrical installation or electrical equipment, “accredited certification scheme” means a scheme of product conformity certification for industrial and commercial electrical work which applies to the work that is to be carried out and which is accredited by the United Kingdom Accreditation Service (UKAS).” In practice, such contractors are likely to be NAPIT and / or NICEIC accredited. Note specifically that domestic electrical installers and amateurs are not permitted to work in churches. Lighting and heating in the Ringing Room are discussed in Running a Tower and points specific to the Bell Chamber in Belfry Upkeep.
Noise # Excessive noise levels from the bells within the Ringing Room make it difficult for ringers to hear each other when ringing and above a certain level could damage hearing.
Outside the tower, neighbours may complain, especially if the bells have not been rung for some time or it is a completely new ring of bells. Such complaints could be interpreted by an Environmental Health Officer as causing a nuisance under the Environmental Protection Act 1990.
Sound management is complex and may need more specialist advice than can be provided by the bell hangers, whether internal or external to the tower. Further information is given in this downloadable PDF.
Sourcing &amp; disposal of materials # New and replacement materials should be sourced responsibly considering environmental and ethical factors. Surplus materials may be sold, made available for reuse, recycled or as a last resort disposed of optimally. Items removed from the original installation should be preserved, see Historical and Conservation.
Appropriate arrangements may be set out in the contract specification.
Architects # Projects that are likely to involve changes to the structure of the building will require the services of an architect. Within the Church of England there will usually be a formally appointed Church Architect who may have to be involved in some tower projects. However, they may not have the specific expertise or experience to undertake all aspects of the proposed project and complementary or supplementary advice may be necessary.
Structural Engineers # Advice may be necessary on the structural integrity of the tower, and how the bells may affect the tower or vice versa. Some towers experience quite noticeable movement during ringing. This is unlikely to cause damage to the tower but it may result in difficulty in striking the bells well. Some pioneering work was done on this in the 1990s and, more recently, the topic has been revisited, taking advantage of developments in electronic technology. A summary of the current position was published in The Ringing World, Issue 5783, 25 February 2022, pp178-179. This summary is also available as this downloadable PDF.
There are very few structural engineers who have a full understanding of the implications of bells being rung full circle on a tower and who could advise on bell projects. Some who are known to undertake contracts associated with bell work are included, without recommendation, in Specialist Services.
Historical and Conservation # Depending on the historical and conservation status of the tower, frame and bells, advice may be needed from various local and national organisations. Some may wish to suggest or even impose certain conditions on specific aspects of the work. The tower authorities may already be in contact with relevant organisations from previous projects.
Heritage bodies like Historic England and amenity societies, for example, SPAB - Society for the Preservation of Ancient Buildings, will normally need to be consulted as their views may need to be heeded and these will often influence plans and costs. Whilst their requirements may not be compulsory, the Diocesan Advisory Committee and ultimately the Chancellor of the Diocese will take their views into account.
Archaeologists may be required, especially if ground disturbance is envisaged – such as when a project involves church building works. There are local volunteer groups and county archaeology teams in most areas.
In disposing of items removed during the project, care must be taken to preserve what may be deemed to be historic / heritage or artistic items of interest. In the Church of England faculty rules, there are repeated references to sale or other disposal of an article of architectural, archaeological, artistic or historic interest. Specific requirements may be stipulated in the faculty after consideration of reports from other agencies involved. Even graffiti on stone or woodwork may help shed light on the previous ringers and other users of the church and therefore be considered as of value – and of interest to future generations.
Note that historic information may be a benefit as well as a constraint. Local historians may have information about the history of the church, including any original bells, and this may help to generate interest in your appeal for funds. Environmental Considerations # Points covered in this section are an ongoing concern for any tower. They need to be considered as part of a project because:
The condition may be particularly bad if the installation has been neglected for many years Removal of material and fittings during a project may offer better access for checks Bats # Bats are a protected species: they and their roosts must not be disturbed. Contractors will advise on the presence of bats, how proposed work could affect them and mitigating actions. Work may need to be timed to minimise risks of disturbance. Advice is available here.
Birds # Birds are protected in the UK under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. Work will need to be planned around the nesting season if any birds are present in or around the tower.
If birds are already roosting and nesting in the tower, their droppings and nest material will need to be removed before work can commence. If extensive, this is a major operation with possible health hazards which may need to be carried out by a specialist contractor. Advice is available here. The project will then need to include installing or improving the mesh over louvres and window openings in the tower to remove the risk from birds and their nest material.
Birds are not always bad. Peregrines nesting on the outside of a tower are a wildlife attraction and may help to keep other birds away. In one tower at least, boxes for nesting Swifts have been fitted within the louvres but outside the protective netting – a valuable help to a species that is losing many of its traditional nesting places.
Grey squirrels, rats and mice # Figure 2: Squirrels high up on the tower at Coddington, Herefordshire.
Grey squirrels may look attractive (Figure 2) but they cause damage within buildings. They can gnaw woodwork, strip insulation from electrical cables and contaminate the area with urine and droppings. They are most likely to gain access to a tower through louvres or broken windows and, as for birds, this must be addressed in your project.
Rates and mice present similar problems but controlling their access may be more difficult. Specialist assistance will be needed if they present a problem.
Woodworm and Death Watch Beetle # Figure 3: Typical woodworm flight holes in timber. These holes appear old – newly made holes that are undisturbed often have the evidence of wood dust alongside.
Worm or beetle attack (Figure 3) on timber within the tower will require appropriate specialist advice and treatment, even if the timber is not fulfilling a structural function. Professional contractors will need to ensure that their treatments will be suitable considering other species present and the nature of the fabric being treated.
Fungal decay # Wet or dry rot in the tower, if present, will need attention as part of a tower project. A qualified surveyor may be needed to assess the extent of the damage and will recommend treatment, possibly including the removal of affected material. This may require the strengthening of any structural timber, such as support beams or parts of a bell frame. Wet rot is more likely where there are leaks and these must be rectified before further work is carried out.
Analysing and Using Advice # The information gathered may be complex and even inconsistent, making it difficult to interpret. You need to be aware that some of those offering advice may have their own prejudices or their own interests at heart. You may encounter “instant experts”.
You will need to understand and balance the information given, particularly where there are conflicts. This is where the support of team members will help. If necessary, ask for additional information and clarification; better to do so at an early stage, as once the project is underway it may be technically or financially difficult to alter.

`}),e.add({id:3,href:"/docs/035-permissions-approvals/",title:"Permissions & Approvals",section:"Docs",content:` Permissions &amp; Approvals # Over 90% of the 7000 towers with 3 or more bells hung for full circle change ringing are in a Church of England Church, the remainder being owned by other churches, trusts, local authorities or privately whether in the UK or overseas. This means that bell ringers embarking on a bell project must act in conjunction with others who own and have responsibility for the tower and installation. Other formal permissions and approvals required will depend on ownership and location, but also factors such as the heritage status of the tower and bells. These notes therefore need to be used in conjunction with the relevant laws and requirements that may be applicable in the UK or elsewhere. This is discussed further in Belfry Upkeep.
Church of England Towers # In the Church of England, it is the Incumbent, Church Wardens and PCC who first have to agree to any work on a bell installation in the tower. The Project Team have a responsibility to work closely with them, ensuring a good working relationship. Without this, the project may fail.
Permission for anything other than routine maintenance and certainly for more major bell projects, must be obtained according to the “Faculty Jurisdiction” process. Minor maintenance, as included in “List A” of the process, may be undertaken without higher levels of permission. Other relatively minor work, as in “List B”, must be approved by the Archdeacon. A useful PDF guide to the application of Lists A and B is provided here. More substantial projects will require a full Faculty application via the Diocesan Registrar to the Chancellor of the Diocese concerned. Most dioceses now have an online system accessed by specific parish officers.
A Faculty will be granted legally by the Diocesan Chancellor, a judge appointed by the Bishop. The Faculty application comprises a set of documents about the project proposed along with information about the church. The application will be reviewed by the Diocesan Advisory Committee (DAC). A key role is that of the Diocesan Bells Advisor, whose primary role is to advise the DAC for the Chancellor.
The process for getting a Faculty may be lengthy, but many churches will have experience of applying for a Faculty and each diocese will have their own guidance on their website.
Being a legal process there can be significant financial penalties for individuals held responsible for not following the requirements. Albeit rare, an example of this occurred in Michaelchurch Escley in Herefordshire, see here. Towers Elsewhere # Outside the Church of England and also for English Cathedrals, project approval processes are different. It will be the relevant owning authority who will advise on the processes that are used to make their decisions on a proposed project, as discussed here.
Other Permissions and Approvals # As explained on the Churchcare website, secular and amenity organisations must be consulted, especially when listed buildings and contents may be involved. These organisations may impose conditions about how a project can proceed, for example that certain historic materials are left in place. In such cases, it must be ensured that any compromises negotiated and agreed will not adversely affect the outcome of the whole project.
Part of the initial planning will therefore involve finding out who has to give agreement and for what. Ascertaining their perspectives and identifying the points that they are likely to raise may smooth planning and getting agreement, by having answers to likely questions. Find out how each organisation operates – some will be willing to have informal discussions so make use of these, while others may operate a more formal process that does not allow informal contacts.
Little if any work can go ahead before all agreements are in place. In some instances, one organisation will only commit after one or more other specific agreements are finalised.
Planning Permission # This is not normally required when the external appearance of a church will remain unchanged. See here. However, if the project entails, for example, extension to the building or changes to windows or doorways, then local authority planning permission is likely to be required.
Listed Building Consent # This is not likely to be required for a church that is covered by the Ecclesiastical Exemption.
Miscellaneous Permissions # Work such as the installation of new mains services (for example electricity and water) may involve not only the suppliers but permissions from other landowners if other property is to be affected. Depending on the location of the tower, there may be a need for road closures or the imposition of temporary parking restrictions during certain phases of the work to enable large vehicles to access the tower. This will require permission from the relevant local authority. Access may also be required to adjacent property if space around the building is constrained. If the tower is adjacent to neighbours who will be sensitive to unusual noise or traffic, then it is polite to warn them and take advice on their requirements. Examples could include schools (especially in exam seasons), hospitals, care homes or very sensitive commercial premises. It is worthwhile keeping on good terms with them by accommodating their interests!

`}),e.add({id:4,href:"/docs/040-managing-project/",title:"Managing the Project",section:"Docs",content:` Managing the Project # A plan to go from this… # Figure 1: Old timber frame at Hitcham, Suffolk
As a project takes shape there may be enthusiasm to make progress, particularly start raising money. However, it is advisable to plan the project, considering in some detail what has to be done when, how, by whom, with what resources first. The plan will ideally run from the earliest discussions through to project completion. Careful planning should reduce the overall duration, save money and make sure that the whole project runs smoothly and meets its aims.
TOP TIP: Asking who, what, when, where, why, how, are useful prompts at every stage! There is a wide range of material available about planning and running projects. Look for basic guides online and in books. A focus on charities and the voluntary sector is most likely to be helpful for bell projects. There is no “right” way to manage a project so this guidance should be adjusted to fit the specific project.
A particularly comprehensive set of information about church projects is here.
Scheduling Activities # The project leader will usually consider the project in stages, with each stage reaching a logical point, for example:
Scoping the project - concept definition and information gathering Requesting permission and detailed planning Selecting contractors and placing contracts Undertaking the work off site and on site Completion and close down Key dates, activities, their durations and milestones should be planned in conjunction with those involved, i.e. stakeholders, contractors and suppliers.
Much of the detailed work in each stage will be managed by various contractors, but coordinating their activities is a key role of the project leader. Not every activity needs to be sequential and time will be saved if activities are accomplished in parallel whenever possible.
Be realistic when planning the timetable, not optimistic, as approvals and tasks often take longer than anticipated. At every stage consider the risks and include contingencies to prevent the whole project timescale drifting. The risk is that when time is short, people and activities may be rushed, so accidents and errors may increase. But leaving time for contingencies is not an excuse for poor planning.
Identify clearly the key dates that have to be fixed. For example, a decision making committee may only meet once a quarter, so find out when their meetings will be held, when they need information to be submitted, and note these in the plan.
Plan meetings with stakeholders, contractors and suppliers. While some meetings may now be virtual, face to face meetings are still very effective and often enable better personal interaction, especially in the early stages of a project. Meetings help to keep everyone up to date with progress and also offer the opportunity to ask questions. If on site, then progress will be much more apparent.
Watch what interdependencies there may between various activities: changes in the timing of one activity will affect others that follow. For example, specific equipment and materials will be required at precise times, with some requiring large areas for storage and security until used.
Careful consideration of phasing may enable money to be saved: for example, can the period during which items are hired be minimised, to reduce hire costs?
For every activity in the plan, consider carefully who else needs to be involved and what else will be needed. Talking through each activity with members of the project team may expose key points that are easily overlooked yet may be critical and time consuming. When and how will reports be required for the PCC, funders and other stakeholders – verbal, written, electronic / on paper? Reports at specific times may be essential for funders so should not be missed! Adding them to the plan, with time allocated for preparation, may take a few minutes but can save problems and potentially loss of income.
Some grant awarding bodies require reports, data and other actions both during and after the project is complete, some even a few years after the project has been finished. Plan how this will be achieved, even as team members change and show how that data and information will be collected as the project proceeds.
How will progress, changes to the plan or changes of approach be notified to others and recorded? This is all part of good communication – whether by phone, email or electronic tools. It is easy to overlook people who may wish or need to be informed, so setting up specific mailing lists is a wise and efficient way of working.
At the end of the project, leave time to complete all the formalities and tidy up. There may be additional correspondence to be completed so these must be added to records as they are archived for future reference.
Lack of planning can lead to what are described as “unforseen consequences” but they may be the result of poor planning! Ultimately, project management ensures that everything happens, when and how it should!
Project Management Tools # It is advisable for the project leader to set up systematic ways of managing the project. Comprehensive software packages are available, some very expensive, others freely available, but these are not necessary. It is more important for all those involved to be able to access information and use it. The normal cautions apply if free software is used.
Calendar # A calendar is a good way of showing the start and end dates of activities in each stage, along with specific milestones, deadlines and events highlighted. Larger projects involving other work in the church are likely to be divided into major phases, only one of which may directly concern the bells.
A long term project may aim first to replace ageing electrical, plumbing and heating systems, then the addition of audio visual aids and wifi. This may be followed by repairs to tower stonework, creation of an accessible entrance and restoration of the bells. Phase 3 could be a building extension with kitchen, serving hatch, meeting rooms and toilet. Each phase would be run as if a separate project, but with careful planning for activities that are interdependent, such as anticipating electrical work in phase 1 for the building extensions in phase 3. An online calendar enables team members to share and update information as progress is made. Online calendars usually offer the option to show different levels of detail.
A large wall planner displayed at a central location such as in the church, is useful to show progress against key milestones.
Project information documents and records # Information and documents will be generated and received during a project, including key formal decisions and agreements, as well as useful reference materials. Much of this will be referred to during the project and key documents must be archived on completion. For example:
Calendars showing project timetable Records of activities, meeting agendas and minutes, events, progress reports Terms of reference and appointments for key people Contact details Formal contract documents, permissions (respecting commercial confidentiality) Financial records, bank statements Correspondence Event arrangements Presentations, displays Physical artefacts Risk register Health and safety information Reference documents – useful information The project leader should develop systematic ways of managing information and documentation, including how it can be shared. Most will be in electronic format but some items will still be received on paper particularly those that require wet signatures. A scanned copy of these will be useful, but originals should be retained and archived at the end of the project.
A clear file name convention, good version control, and backup system is essential from the start of the project, as it will save a lot of time, especially as the volume of information expands. Sorting after the project has started is not easy!
Information from suppliers and contractors may be commercially sensitive so should be identified distinctly and handled appropriately. Personal information (contact details, names, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses etc) must be stored and managed so that only appropriate people have access to it and consistent with the requirements of the 2018 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A specific statement should define how personal data will be managed in the project, probably based on that set out by the church concerned.
Some grant awarding bodies require reports, data and other actions during and after the project is complete, some even a few years after the project has been finished so plan for this as the project proceeds.
Photographic records # Photographs and videos are easy to take electronically and will be useful when creating a complete documentary record of the project from the very start through to completion that can be preserved as part of the tower history. As well as being useful, informative and interesting, pictures are helpful as reminders of the status of the project at certain points as well as useful publicity in the course of the project. Perhaps enlist the support of members of a local photographic society as they may be willing to be involved in a more unusual project themselves. Bell towers are often dark and cramped so will pose interesting challenges even for the most enthusiastic amateur photographers!
Money Management # Formally, money for the project is likely to the responsibility of the Church Treasurer as they will have the authority for payments and bank transactions. However, a project treasurer can help the project leader with costing the work, reviewing financial elements of quotations and contracts, then controlling and managing project funds as income is received and payments are made. Good record keeping is essential and many grant awarding bodies will expect evidence of expenditure and related financial records.
Cash flow will be a concern when more money has to be paid out before it has been raised or received. Contractors will set out the payment terms in their contract and some money may be required in advance, with further stage payments once specific work has been completed. The dates on which payments are due should be included the calendar.
Details of project finance are covered here.
Running the project # Once all the plans and approvals are in place, along with evidence of the money being available, then the project can start and can become frenetic!
Who will have the last ring on the old bells? This is likely to be a question asked by ringers so plans are likely to include the last quarter peal, last peal and last general ringing. Plan who will be involved in each of these events and use them as publicity opportunities.
Decommissioning and preparations # Preliminary work will usually be required before external contractors can start the bell related work – for example, in clearing items that are in routine use: chairs, tables, books, papers etc. Are they to be retained in storage, refurbished or disposed of?
It may be necessary to provide protective sheeting and covering for immovable items like flooring, monuments and organ to prevent damage and ingress of dust or debris.
Volunteer labour may undertake some of this but some tasks may require specialist contractors, such as organ builders to protect an organ. Work by volunteers will require advance agreement of the church and main contractors. Bell hangers are accustomed to working with volunteers, subject to insurance arrangements being agreed and project specific risk assessments in place.
Undertaking the work # Figure 2: A short video taken at the start of the Eastnor, Herefordshire, bells project
The central phase in the project is usually the period during which contractors and volunteers arrive and undertake their work, with a quantities of material and equipment. It will be both exciting as changes take place but also will need careful coordination! Additional items may be required at precise times, and some will require secure storage until used.
At the outset, each contractor will be largely unfamiliar with the location so will need to be assisted with all the formalities (procedures, safety, security etc) and practicalities (toilets, eating and changing facilities etc). It is very easy for clashes to occur even with the best planning so it is essential that the project leader is available to resolve matters as they arise. Not having something or someone available at the right time and place is also likely; alternative arrangements will often have to be made.
Any alteration inevitably means that there are consequences on other activities – being able to notify those concerned and revise all the arrangements can be a challenge!
Delays and unexpected challenges will occur and need to be resolved. A mobile phone and good contacts list will be invaluable but only if there is a phone signal in the tower! Also remember to document any changes agreed with all parties concerned so that everyone is very clear.
Figure 3: Eastnor – the bells return
Snagging # The contract terms should set out how and by when remedial work will be completed. The project leader should create a &ldquo;snagging list&rdquo; (&ldquo;punch list&rdquo; in the US) of items that do not meet contractual acceptance criteria and report them to the contractor concerned as soon as possible. As these items are completed by the contractor, they should be rechecked, and then marked completed. During your review of punch list items, keep a careful eye out as new items may be caused by remedial work and if any are noted, they should be added to the punch list and remediated. When the snagging process is completed, the project can move onto the next step.
Blessing and Dedication # It is customary for the Bishop or other senior church representative to bless the bells, if possible while they are still visible in the church or church yard before being lifted into the tower. This may be at a special service or as part of another church service or ringing event. Often the precise time within the project plan will not be known until relatively late so organisation may be quite complicated. Bells are at risk of theft while not hung in the tower so additional security arrangements may be required.
Alternatively, the re-dedication may be after the bells have been rehung and perhaps rung open (audibly) for the first time. A video link from the bell chamber to the church can be used so that the bells are visible on a screen during the service. The bells would normally not be rung (other than for basic testing) before the dedication service.
Recommissioning # Plans should set out when and how the bells will be recommissioned. The first ringing after the bells are installed and functioning will usually be by an experienced band who can assist in assessing the new installation with the bell hangers. The acceptance criteria should be set out in the project plans. Ensure that all work activities are completed before each contract is signed off as complete and money paid.
These points should be made clear in the contract.
Completion, First Ringing and Reporting # Once all work is completed satisfactorily, the tower should be cleaned throughout and items in routine use replaced – chairs, tables, etc. This is an opportunity to clean, restore or replace used items and install additional items to update the facilities available.
Some funders and supporters request reports or evidence that work is complete and these should be supplied stating that they fulfil this requirement. For example, a “Certificate of Practical Completion” must be recorded on the Church of England website.
The project leader should “tidy up” files and records then archive material after an appropriate interval.
It is wise to agree early in the project who and when the first quarter peal and peal are to be rung. This avoids pre-emptive moves by other enthusiastic ringers. Invite ringers who have contributed a lot to the project whether practically, financially or in other ways. Also consider ringers who have had a long association with the tower, even if no longer active locally.
Warning neighbours in advance of ringing recommencing will help avoid complaints and can be an opportunity to recruit new recruits.
And last but not least - Celebrate!

`}),e.add({id:5,href:"/docs/050-project-team/",title:"Project Team",section:"Docs",content:` Project Team # A project may be proposed by one or two individuals with ambitions to achieve certain outcomes. However, it is usually better for a small group of people with a wider range of skills, interests and experiences to work together to make the project a success. It is advisable that the project is not the direct responsibility of an existing committee such as the PCC as that will usually have many other commitments and structured ways of operating; the team will need flexibility to plan the work and establish ways of working that will achieve the outcomes intended.
Appointing the Project Team # Project Leader # The tower authority should appoint a project leader. Previous experience of managing projects may be helpful whether professionally or voluntarily but is not essential. Interest, a logical approach plus time available are probably most important.
Importantly, the leader should be willing to work with others whether volunteers, contractors, those consulted and giving advice, and other stakeholders. The leader need not to be “the best ringer”, tower captain or steeple keeper, but should have some knowledge of ringing and bell installations.
The leader’s terms of appointment should be agreed ideally in writing, outlining the scope of their responsibilities, what is to be achieved, timescales and any constraints.
TOP TIP: Project Leader is a responsible and important role, not to be undertaken lightly. Team Members # The leader should have the authority to appoint a small team, after consultation with the tower authorities, to assist with various aspects of the project. Team members may be allocated a specific role such as Project Secretary or Treasurer, consistent with their skills, interests and time available. What they agree to do should be set out in writing. Importantly, the team should be able to provide continuity if key individuals are unavailable.
Offers of help should be valued and accepted but not every volunteer needs to be a full team member, for example, someone may be willing to contribute to a certain activity or for a certain period but not involved otherwise.
Team members need not all be bell ringers; they may be able to contribute in other ways and will certainly gain new experiences. Volunteers may subsequently become involved in church activities and ringing, having not been involved previously. Young people helping will learn a lot and potentially help their careers! For those under 18, parental consent is essential. Safeguarding arrangments must be in place for all young and vulnerable helpers.
Team Working # The team should discuss and agree how they intend to operate, share workload and activities, distribute information and maintain records. The team will need to meet periodically to discuss and agree key matters, supplemented by frequent electronic communications.
As team members get to know each other, they will build a rapport enabling them to work together through the project. There will be high and low points, frustrations and successes; socialising together will help!
TOP TIP: Match roles to the team of people available. Team Members and Roles # The following are examples of roles that may be required. Note that several roles may be combined or may not be necessary, depending on the scale of the project and interests of those involved.

If helping professional contractors such as bell hangers, then this must be agreed in advance with the companies concerned and the volunteers must follow guidance and instructions from the relevant professionals. Bell hangers may agree as part of the contract to reduce the price of the work if volunteers agree to help with aspects of the work.
Young people under 18 (with parental consent in accordance with safeguarding requirements) can be encouraged to assist according to their age, maturity and interests. They will have a great experience, learn a little about bell installations, and contribute enthusiastically. Even younger children enjoy helping, for example, carrying just small items from a van to the church door.
Some people will be technically minded, but many with other skills will contribute:
IT, computing – website, blog, project tools, presentations, brochure layout historians – a history of the bells, past ringers, ringing events in the context of the local town or village locations craftspeople and tradesmen – painting, woodwork, metal work associated with the project, with contractors or small additional items of use, or for sale. Perhaps using items recycled from items removed from the tower as part of the project musicians – the music of bell ringing, handbells in concerts, schools, fund raising events artists and designers – artwork for displays, presentations posters, grant applications, website, brochure photographers – record of project, imagery for website, blog building owners – venues, parking for events chefs, caterers - events and fund raising volunteer labour - working under guidance of the professional contractors, clearing items, lifting, carrying, moving, sweeping and cleaning …… there is potential in everyone!
Volunteers may be able to assist with:
Donation or loan at no or reduced cost - equipment, tools, scaffold, fork lifts Heavy lift and transport of bells to and from bell hangers premises Dismantling components and removing them from the tower Cleaning, preparation and finishing in the tower Carrying materials and components back into the tower Frame assembly and painting Installing fittings and components Installing new flooring, ceiling, furniture, wiring Painting, decorating ringing room and other space Installing external sound control and ensuring good internal acoustics Provision of overnight accommodation, washing and changing facilities, refreshments Hosting visitors, running errands Recognition of Project Team # A nice touch is to provide public recognition of at least the main members of the project team, perhaps by a plaque in the ringing room (Figure 1).

`}),e.add({id:6,href:"/docs/060-stakeholder-engagement/",title:"Stakeholder Engagement",section:"Docs",content:` Stakeholder Engagement # Bell ringers are likely to understand the reasons for a bell project but others may have little understanding of the justification for the project and expense, or even have much knowledge of bells and bell ringing. The image of monks and choir boys swinging on bell ropes as depicted on Christmas cards, is pervasive but misleading.
The project team therefore will explain the reasons for the project, how it will contribute to the life of the church and the whole community, not just a few bell ringers! As well as being factual, it will be necessary to inspire and enthuse people.
Some stakeholders may also be willing to donate money towards the project. This should not be the only purpose of engaging with them and will not be the focus of this chapter. That is dealt with later.
This chapter provides a general description of stakeholder engagement. An Addendum provides more detailed ideas which you might also want to consider.
Who are Stakeholders? # Anyone with a potential interest or reason to know about the project. The team may identify stakeholders by thinking logically but also laterally in “brain storming” sessions.
Owners and those responsible for the bells and tower – since about 90% of bells hung for change ringing are in Church of England churches , this will be the church incumbent, PCC, church wardens, plus the relevant Diocesan advisers and authorities. Other jurisdictions will have similar arrangements. This is discussed further here. Users - primarily bell ringers from the tower and local area who will ring the bells for services and practices, and other specific events such as baptisms, weddings, funerals and memorial services at the church. Increasingly, there are requests for bells to be rung to mark local and national events and occasions, such as fetes, new year and royal occasions. Parishioners, neighbours and wider local communities in the parish, town or village, particularly those within audible range - local residents, schools, colleges, workplaces, public bodies, local clubs, societies and charities. Also like-minded individuals and groups, historians, archaeologists, family history groups … Local and regional authorities – many churches are listed buildings. Increasingly, churches are offering a range of diverse services in the local community. Other members of the public – those who may benefit from the project or have an interest. This could include people and groups locally and more widely, even internationally. For example, individuals and families who may have had connections with the church, village or town, but have since moved away. Many people associate bells with weddings and funerals. Some families may even have relatives who were associated with previous bell project so may be supportive of the project proposed. Involve them early as this could reduce the risks of misunderstanding or objections later. Suppliers and contractors – A bell hanging company may be a prime contractor but with sub-contractors or suppliers of goods and services - structural engineers, electrical contractors, carpentry, painting, etc. This is discussed further here. Special Interest groups – locally and elsewhere. For example, historians, heritage bodies and conservation authorities. Donors – funds towards the project, either in cash or in kind; individuals, charities, government agencies, local groups, businesses … Involve stakeholders as fully as possible, not just a source of money or suppliers of the work!
TOP TIP: Get all stakeholders engaged, enthused and involved. Use their skills and contacts. When to Involve Stakeholders # Stakeholders are involved at various stages during planning and decision-making so that they are aware of aspects that may affect them or be of interest. Some will be engaged just once, some more frequently. Plan carefully when to engage with them at key times so that that they can make timely contributions.
Initial consultation # At the early stages, key members of the tower and church are likely to be involved and they will help shape the project. Accept suggestions and discuss what could be included as the views of others may identify where there will be further support or challenges. Some people will have very detailed questions while others may be more general.
Once the plans become clearer, then it is appropriate to raise further interest in the project more widely. Avoid starting too early as partially developed ideas may give the impression that the project is risky or poorly managed so some people will be unsupportive or even oppose it.
Formal project launch # With approval from the authorities, a major event can be held to launch the project. This typically aims to raise its profile of the project as well as start significant fund raising. Usually there will be a function, typically in the church concerned or nearby. Other events will usually be held at about the same time, each tailored to suit a specific audience. Involving high profile influential dignitaries at a launch helps to create an impact.
The project is likely to be launched before the faculty and other approvals are received so it should be made clear that any work will be dependent on final approvals granted.
Events # Events take a lot of planning, hard work and effort and do not necessarily raise income in proportion. You may find, however, that organising and participating in events has a beneficial effect in terms of publicity and motivation that outweighs financial rewards. Details are given in the Addendum.
Marking key points # Once the project is underway, the project will reach particular milestones and these will be opportunities to update stakeholders – and to celebrate. These may coincide with receipt of specific approvals such as the faculty, when significant sums of money have been raised, or when phases of the work begin or are completed.
Keeping stakeholders aware of progress is an important part of any project. Consider when certain groups may wish to know when certain activities will occur, for example, neighbours will want to be know when work will start as there may be some congestion around the tower with additional vehicles, even necessitating road closures for short periods, noise being generated by equipment and so on. Similarly, alerting neighbours when the bells will start ringing perhaps after a long period of silence.
Dedication and blessing of the bells # It is customary for the bells to be blessed prior to them being (re)installed in the tower. This is an ideal opportunity to involve stakeholders, particularly those who have made major contributions or offered assistance in kind. Since bells are not usually visible after installation, the ideal opportunity for a blessing and dedication service will be when the bells have been delivered from the foundry and are in the church yard or on the church floor prior to being hoisted into the tower. If the bells are not to be removed from the belfry during the project, there may still be a rededication service with CCTV used to enable the bells to be seen.
Figure 1: A new ring of 8 bells, delivered and ready to be installed
While it is wonderful if a senior person such as the Bishop will officiate, fixing a date in their busy schedule will need to be planned well in advance. Whatever is planned, this service will be a good opportunity to invite all the stakeholders and to make it a great occasion.
Project completion and celebration # This is likely to involve a service and more extended event at the culmination of the project. The date chosen will aim to include appropriate stakeholders, including those who have had input into the project such as donors, workers on the project, both voluntary local labour and bell foundry/bell hanger workers, church officers and, of course, local bellringers and representatives of the local Guild or Association. Invite representatives from local organisations such as schools and businesses, Councillors, as well as nearby residents even if they aren’t churchgoers or haven’t been involved in the project. The understanding and forbearance of local residents will be very important during the training of new ringers, even if there is appropriate sound control. With the formal reopening of the tower, allow plenty of time for the first touches by carefully selected bands of ringers, followed by open ringing. Consider carefully who will ring the first quarter peal and peal on the bells.
The event may include refreshments and reception either in the church or at a nearby hall to include all those involved in the project and allow formal thanks to be expressed. The attendance of the local press and the taking of photographs will help maintain the project in the public eye. Such events are opportunities to engage with people who may express interest and could be attracted to learn to ring. Look out especially for comments such as “I used to ring…” from lapsed ringers – they will soon remember how to ring, even if nervous at first!
After completion # When all the hard work (and fun) is complete, do not underestimate the task of making the best use of your new ring of bells: re-establishing the band, teaching new ringers and fulfilling a programme of ringing for church and important national events. You may find it useful to keep in touch with some of the stakeholders you have met during the project – they may be able to assist you in the development of your band.
Finally, there is likely to be a succession of requests by visiting bands to ring on the new or restored bells so consider these carefully so that there is not too much disturbance for neighbours and that a quarter peal does not pre-empt the first one planned for your own band!
Ideas for Engagement # That completes a general description of stakeholder engagement. The Addendum to this chapter provides more detailed ideas which you might want to consider.

`}),e.add({id:7,href:"/docs/070-contract-specification/",title:"Contract Specification",section:"Docs",content:` Contract Specification # Setting out what is to be done in the contract is critical. This defines (a) what is to be done by contractor(s) and (b) the expected outcome of the project. Once the contract is placed, changes may be difficult to make, whether for reasons of practicality or cost. The outcomes of bell projects are normally expected to last for a very long time, decades if not centuries, so it is essential to make sure that the contract is comprehensive and accurate.
This chapter sets out general advice on drawing up a request for quotation, which will then lead to a contract; an addendum to this chapter covers technical options which you may need to consider in tailoring your specification to your particular situation.
Before You Start # We use the term ‘Tower Authority’ here to refer to the churchwardens and Parochial Church Council for towers within the Church of England and to their equivalents in other jurisdictions. You must be certain that the Tower Authority and the ringers understand and accept what is proposed to be achieved. This will be based on your scoping of the project and the specialist advice you have obtained, including outline estimates of the likely cost.
There may well be different opinions and expectations. The Tower Authority often have cost uppermost in their minds, particularly if their experience and knowledge of bells and bellringing is limited. They may also anticipate other higher priority projects. The ringers may argue that a more comprehensive and expensive project may be more cost effective and bring additional benefits for the medium and longer term – although they will need not to be carried away by the thought of lovely new ring of bells!
A proper understanding can only be obtained by trust and openness on all sides.
Requesting Quotations # The formal Client for the work is the Tower Authority so requests for quotations must be placed by them. The ringers will make a significant contribution to drawing up those quotation requests. The Contractor will be a bell hanger or bell foundry – see Specialist Services but note that the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers does not endorse or recommend specific companies.
Points to be included in the request for quotation are given below. You may need to include other technical points as described in the addendum.
General points # The Tower Authority may expect to ask for more than one equivalent quote. It should be recognised, however, that the number of bell hangers (Contractors) is very limited and there may be clear reasons why one company will be preferred. For example, the company may have cast and installed the bells and still have the original design and specifications, even decades or a century or more later!
Competitive quotations can be misleading for a variety of reasons and this is the reason for ensuring that the contract specifies the work completely. If you simply ask for the bells to be rehung, one contractor might offer cast-iron headstocks while another offers fabricated steel; one may offer a new frame using traditional cast-iron sideframes while another offers a fully fabricated steel frame, and yet another offers to repair the old frame. One offer may be the best solution and another the cheapest but you should not be in the position of having to judge when the quotations are finally before you – and the contractors should not be put in the position of having to waste time guessing what you want. The quotation should outline the requirements and expectations, perhaps with options. If the terms are too prescriptive then this may constrain the Contractor. Conversely, not being specific enough (for example, simply asking for the condition of the bells to be improved) may make it difficult to compare the specifications and quotes received, and ultimately to assess whether the Contractor has fulfilled the contract in accordance with the specifications.
Parts of the work may include items not part of the bell installation – masonry work on the tower or work related to access, for example. Possible examples are discussed in more detail in the addendum. This will require the use of sub-contractors. It is usually clearer and lower risk for the contract to be with the bell hanging company (the Main Contractor). They then place any subsidiary contracts necessary for aspects of the work that will be required but do not provide themselves.
TOP TIP Get quotes for the same detailed and agreed project specification Programme # The quotation request will set the expected date of completion and clearly define the expected condition at that point. The Contractor will confirm this or suggest an alternative. The Contractor may also offer a programme showing the major phases of the work.
The Contractor will identify steps to be taken to maintain the programme in the event of unexpected delays and how contract amendments are to be agreed.
Financial # The Contractor will provide an overall cost for the work possibly including part-payments at specific points. The progress at those points will be clearly defined and subject to checking by the Client.
The quotation request may define what payment is retained for snagging (the US term is &ldquo;completing the punch list&rdquo;) and for how long. The Contractor will agree to this or offer an alternative.
The Contractor may include a follow-up inspection at some interval after completion. The details and cost of this will be given.
The Contractor will state what guarantee is offered and against what circumstances.
Insurance # The Contractor will set out the insurance provisions for items not covered by the tower insurance policy. This will include, but not be limited to, the following:
Damage to the bells and other parts of the installation during lifting operations Covering loss or damage of the bells while: Stored in the church During transport to and from the Contractor’s premises While at the Contractor’s premises Volunteer labour Possible savings # The Contractor may be invited to suggest any possible savings. These could include, but not be limited, to the following:
Relaxation of some of the requirements in the request for quotation Discount allowed for the provision of local volunteer labour, including any restrictions on age and experience and requirements for personal protective equipment. Provision by the tower of items available locally without cost to assist movement of equipment, for example: Protection of flooring and furniture Removal of items of furniture (for example, seating) to provide space for work Accommodation overnight, if needed, for contract staff Removal and retention of components and materials which may be useful for other work Comparing Quotations # Bell hangers and bell founding contractors are niche specialists and will recommend and quote for what they consider will produce a good outcome. Different companies may have different views on what should be done and how, and they may offer more than one option. This can make it difficult to compare quotations received, especially where specialist jargon is used that may be unfamiliar.
Take time to compare the quotes. Some details may need interpretation as they could have considerably different benefits and costs. Tempting as it may be, it is not advisable to accept the lowest price for that reason alone. Similarly, omitting items from those advised to reduce costs may result in non-optimum solutions or additional expense later.
When comparing quotes, it will be useful to put them side by side so that the similarities and differences are apparent. Refer back to previous discussions to make sure that what is offered will be acceptable. If extra is offered, is that really necessary or is it a helpful addition not previously considered? Are key activities in a logical order, are they compatible with church users and consistent with the original plans. Has anything been omitted?
Points to consider # In no particular order:
How are contract amendments to be agreed? Is there clarity on who is paying for what? Are there any hidden costs? Which items are new and which refurbished? Where will materials be stored once delivered to site? Who is responsible for the disposal of items removed? Materials to be used – what will be the longer term maintenance requirements? Delivery of large and heavy items may require vehicles to access the tower, perhaps along narrow country lanes or though congested urban streets? Will roads need to be closed and for what periods? If so, permission will be required through the local highways department. If permission is given, then it will probably be for a specific date and time so this must then become a critical date in the calendar! Will a lifting beam need to be installed in the tower? Who is to provide equipment required, tools, scaffold, etc. Is it tested and insured? Who is providing specialist tools and equipment at each stage? Will they be available when required? Don’t make assumptions! Can the loan of a forklift truck save the expense of hiring? Will it be small enough to negotiate the church gates? If voluntary labour is used, what are the requirements for their PPE and insurance? What knowledge do you have of the reputation of the various contractors? How will on site work be phased to have the right people on site at the right time? How are suppliers and contractors considering environmental matters such as minimising waste from packaging? Finalising the Contract # Since PCC members and others reviewing the quotes may not be ringers and familiar with the companies involved, it will be helpful to explain what may not be included in written quotations. For example, the experiences of other towers who have completed projects recently may help the decisions.
If in doubt ask the companies who are quoting. Finally make sure that all parties are completely clear about what is being provided by whom and when – before the person in authority finally signs the contract.

`}),e.add({id:8,href:"/docs/090-project-finance/",title:"Project Finance",section:"Docs",content:` Project Finance # “How much is required and how do we raise the money?” are often the first questions asked when a bell project is suggested. Most churches are short of money whether for routine expenses or for higher priority projects. However, bell projects usually attract donations and support from people who are not otherwise connected with the church, as well as from ringers and regular contributors. Donations may come from unexpected sources, unpredictably, often surprisingly quickly. Bell projects have long-lasting benefits and seem to appeal!
What is the Cost? # The price of a bell project will be determined by the work to be done and as quoted by the main contractor and sub-contractors. Very approximate costs may be indicated by looking at similar projects elsewhere. Additional items such as transport, protection for floors and church fabrics, disposal of surplus items, storage, hire of tools, may not be included in the main contracts.
Price increases are inevitable, especially if the gestation period of the project is several months or years, and inflation rates are high. The bell trade recognises this and may quote a price that will be held for a specified period, but other prices may rise unpredictably. It is wise to add a percentage for genuine and unforeseen contingencies but guard this carefully! It is not an excuse for poor estimating and planning!
Money Management # The money raised will normally held by the Tower Authority, since the bells, fixtures and fittings are the property of the church. The Church Treasurer will be responsible for managing the money formally, but it is helpful for them to be assisted by a project treasurer. A separate fund should be set up within the PCC accounts for the project and this should be recorded in the PCC minutes.
The details of setting up a ‘Project Fund’ (or even a fund for general tower activities) can be complicated. Steve Coleman considers this in a series of articles on Tower Funds in 2023 in The Ringing World. Church of England PCCs are charities, but only those with incomes over a certain level need to register with the Charity Commission so smaller PCCs may not have a Registered Charity Number. This Charitable status offers certain benefits, such as tax savings. Other jurisdictions may have similar arrangements: In the USA, for example, most churches are 501(c)3 charities.
Only occasionally will a separate project fund be set up independent of church accounts, as a registered charity with its own Trustees. The Charity Commission publishes relevant documents on setting up and running a charity. The charity details should show that the money raised will be spent on the church bell project. It also needs to stipulate how any money will be used if there is a residue remaining after the project is complete. For example, it could be retained for future bell maintenance or transferred to another appropriate bell fund. Further advice is available online for England and Wales and for Scotland.
Managing cash flow can be a challenge – with the risk of costs incurred exceeding funds raised at any time. This may arise when grant awarding organisations only pay on project completion. The project manager and treasurer will need to ensure that specific phases of the work can be financed before work commences and payments become due.
The final payments on a contract should only be made after it is certain that all aspects of the contract are fully complete. A proportion of the contract value may be retained for a defined period after completion of the project for “snagging” (referred to in the USA as “completing the punch list”). This enables routine use of the bells for a period after which the bell hangers revisit the installation and make any minor adjustments necessary.
Steve Coleman has contributed a series of helpful articles entitled Ringing and Money to The Ringing World. A list of the references is included below. Schemes Offering Tax Benefits # Listed Places of Worship Grant Scheme # The Listed Places of Worship (LPW) Grant Scheme gives grants covering the VAT on repairs of over £1,000 to listed buildings used as places of worship. You can also submit one claim in any 12-month period that is less than £1,000, but more than £500. This is subject to detailed conditions and you will need to study the website carefully. Fortunately, Steve Coleman has an article &ldquo;Avoiding the Dreaded VAT&rdquo; which provides extensive guidance. Note that the web address quoted in the article has recently changed to the one given here.
Gift Aid # Gift Aid increases the value of donations to the charity from individuals who are UK taxpayers. Higher rate taxpayers also benefit by the difference between the basic rate and higher rate of tax on their donation. The PCC Treasurer should be familiar with the operation of gift aid, and importantly, what donations may or may not be included as gift aided. Note that to claim gift aid, the donor must not receive a &ldquo;benefit”.
Steve Coleman has several articles on Gift Aid.
Gift Aid Small Donations Scheme (GASDS) # This Scheme is for small donations up to a total limit; the administration is more straightforward. Steve Coleman has two articles “GASDS – Gift Aid for Small Donations” and “GASDS and Parish Giving Scheme”.
Payroll Giving # Some employees and recipients of taxed pensions may donate to charities tax-free. Employers will advise on how this operates and information on Payroll Giving can be found on the HM Revenue &amp; Customs website.
Charities Aid Foundation (CAF) Charity Card Account # The donor pays into the account, CAF reclaim tax on behalf of the donor and add it to the account. The card can then be used as a debit card to make individual donations to any registered charity, including small charities.
Reducing Costs # Rather than donating cash, some organisations may lend or donate materials, tools or equipment, provide transport, tradesmen to undertake woodwork or painting. This must be with agreement of professional contractors involved.
School and college students may design and help prepare publicity material, photographs and displays as part of projects, whether for history, music, technology, art.
Individuals and groups may be willing to support the project using their skills and expertise. For example, a local photographic society may be willing to film and photograph the project.
Local venues may offer to open their premises for events, or visits with the proceeds donated to the project fund. Visits to premises that are not normally open to the public may be particularly attractive, such as large and specialist gardens or workplaces.
Raising Money # Fund raising for a specific project is normally led by members of the project team, in conjunction with the Tower Authority. The fund-raising campaign must inspire and enthuse potential donors. With electronic media, fund raising campaigns can be made to reach local, national and international audiences, so need to be tailored to reflect that. Appeals need to be refreshed periodically through well timed major events and smaller activities.
Initial launch # The launch of the project should provide a stimulus for fund raising. A high-profile event can be an occasion to invite prominent people to hear about the project, its aims and how they may be able to support it and promote it.
Donations # Individuals and organisations may donate in response to a well-prepared appeal for money. Even with the widespread use of electronic media, experience shows that a well-presented leaflet distributed widely will generate positive response. Include a donation slip giving online bank details, postal address for cheques and online donation link.
Potential donors are likely to be more generous if they can identify their donation with something tangible. Letters to likely individuals and businesses should focus on their specific interests.
Crowd Funding # This is a modern variant of traditional “public subscription” using online platforms. Ensure that a reputable, trustworthy system is selected.
Legacies # Legacies, some substantial, have unexpectedly provided the stimulus for bell projects. Although a legacy cannot be assumed for any particular project, those writing their will may consider legacies to Bell Restoration Funds held by one of the ringing societies or the Central Council of Church Bell Ringers itself. Steve Coleman has an article &ldquo;Donating in Your Will&rdquo;.
Donations may also be requested in memory of a deceased person in lieu of flowers.
Figure 1: Plaque commemorating a legacy donation
Substantial donations from a legacy should be acknowledged publicly if possible (Figure 1).
Sponsorship of specific items # Sponsoring a new bell is popular as it is a very tangible and lasting item. A bell may be cast with a brief inscription suggested by donor.
Consider whether larger donations could be invited to cover the cost of not only the bell itself but also its headstock, wheel, bearings, clapper, and even sections of the bell frame. In this way, funds are raised for some of the “less attractive” but essential items. Alternatively, individuals and families may be willing to sponsor component parts (for example, wheels, iron and steelwork), and these may be either marked with the donor’s name or the donation recorded on a suitable record board.
Local companies and organisations may make donations as part of their Corporate Social Responsibility, especially if aspects of the project are made to align with their business.
Loans # These may help cash flow. When interest rates are low, a loan “costs” the lender little, but with higher interest rates the “cost” to the lender may become more significant, effectively an additional donation. A loan should be accompanied by formal agreement of the terms on which the loan is made.
Some bell ringing societies maintain bell restoration funds (often registered charities) and the terms of these funds may permit interest free loans.
Volunteer time # Keep a record of time spent by volunteers on the project. This may be accounted as equating to financial contributions to the project by some grant awarding bodies. The record can also provide evidence of the commitment and enthusiasm of many people, a clear demonstration that the project is not one individual’s hobby.
Events # Events take a lot of planning, hard work and effort and do not necessarily raise income in proportion. Their use is discussed in the Addendum to Stakeholder Engagement.
Sales # Some funds may be raised from sales, or auctions of donated items on a pre-defined basis of sharing proceeds. The prominence of online sale and auction websites has reduced the attraction of such events. If buying items to sell at a profit, be very cautious about the choice of items - yet another set of engraved wine glasses or dusty ornaments may not be just the reminder everyone wants to buy! Something related to the church may be more attractive: Figure 1 shows a wooden bowl turned up by a local craftsman from an old beam removed (with permission) from the tower as part of a rehanging project.
Figure 2: Wooden bowl turned from an old beam
Souvenirs # Volunteers may produce a booklet for sale, giving a history of the bells in the context of the church and the proposed project. The material included may be redeployed from what is also used on display boards, in grant applications, talks and presentations. Offers of help may be sought from outside the church and local ringers – for example local history groups, artists, photographers and designers.
Auction of promises # People offer goods or services, with the winning amounts donated to the funds. The promises could range widely: From a ride as passenger on a fast motorbike to a conducted tour around the private rooms of the local stately home.
Applying for Grants # Grants often contribute a large proportion of money to be raised. However, the success rate can be very disappointing (typically found to be about 1 in 3) especially after spending time gathering information and drafting forms. Some funders publicise their typical success rates and this may be a consideration when devoting time to preparing an application.
There are relatively few funders focused solely on bell projects, but you may be eligible for other schemes if the aims and outcomes are designed to fit with the criteria set by the funder. In some cases, it is the requirements of funders that lead to the generation of additional ideas that lead to even more successful projects!
Where to find information # There is a vast volume of information available online but also in public libraries and local community organisations. Spend time researching, discussing with the project team and browsing for ideas.
Take time to find out about likely funders and read their requirements carefully. Grant awarding bodies usually have defined criteria for their awards and many only accept applications at certain times. For each application, read all the criteria, follow the guidance and requirements exactly. Each request must be customised to show how it will fulfil the aims and outcomes of the funder but fitting the success criteria. Time spent preparing will pay off!
Funders may be willing to discuss specific points with the project leader. However, before making contact make sure that the points are not explained in information that is openly available.
Try to find similar projects that have been funded by the organisation previously as it may be possible to contact those who received support and learn from their experiences.
Some funders make a certain number of awards periodically. For example, if a funder distributes £100,000 each year and states that they normally support 10 projects, then this hints that a request for about £8,000 - £12,000 will be the most a single project can expect to receive.
Some funders will expect to see a considerable sum raised through “self-help” before they consider making a grant, while others will see that funds already raised give the impression that their support is unnecessary.
Potential sources of grants # The list of sources below may not be exhaustive. Please contact smSec@cccbr.org.uk with any comments, corrections or suggested additions. Most ringing societies have funds available for bell projects. Contact your local society for details.
The Central Council of Church Bell Ringers has two funds which may be able to offer grants:
The Central Council Bell Restoration Fund generates income primarily from legacies, donations, fundraising offers and bank interest. When funds are available, applications for grants are invited by notices in The Ringing World, on the CCCBR website, and on other communications channels. The Fred E Dukes International Bell Fund is a capital fund and grants can only be paid from the interest earned, which limits the size of grants. Under the terms of the fund, grants are paid only for work carried out by UK bell founders and UK bell-hangers on bell restoration projects in countries outside the UK and Ireland. Applications for grants from the Fund are invited each year by a notice in The Ringing World, on the CCCBR website and by notification to ringing organisations outside the British Isles. The following national organisations may be willing to offer financial support for bell related projects:
PARISH RESOURCES An extensive website with a wealth of information, not just about grants! This site includes links to some of those listed below.
THE BARRON BELL TRUST. Preference is given to churches where the services are Low Church. Do not apply until at least 50% of money has been raised. Preference is given for applications where there is an intention to increase the number of bells to at least six.
CHURCHCARE. Mainly gives grants for ancient bells and bells of historic interest, repairs to listed frames and bells.
THE SHARPE TRUST. Supports maintenance and restoration of bells in England and Wales.
KELTEK TRUST. The Trust helps churches to locate and acquire second-hand bells. The Trust also helps those wishing to dispose of surplus and redundant bells.
HERITAGE LOTTERY FUND. The fund has made grants for bell restoration particularly where the bells are listed for preservation and/or the original bell frame has been kept in use. Grants are not given for new rings of bells or recasting existing bells. The HLF has a variety of programmes which might suit a project if it has a heritage angle. Application can be made for ALL HLF programmes but bear in mind that they are very keen that heritage is the key aspect of the project and will want to see good community involvement.
GARFIELD WESTON FOUNDATION. Particularly interested in projects that demonstrate community involvement.
BENEFACT TRUST. Provides essential support to protect and enhance churches and Christian charity buildings.
LISTED PLACES OF WORSHIP GRANT SCHEME. This scheme applies only to repairs, maintenance and alteration works to listed buildings that are used principally as places of worship and listed places of worship owned by or vested in a number of specified organisations which look after redundant places of worship.
NATIONAL CHURCHES TRUST. Their website states “Every year we help hundreds of churches, chapels and meeting houses to stay open, helping to save precious heritage and keeping churches at the beating heart of local communities.”
LANDFILL COMMUNITIES FUND. The Landfill Communities Fund (LCF) is an innovative tax credit scheme enabling operators of landfill sites in England and Northern Ireland to contribute money to organisations enrolled with ENTRUST as Environmental Bodies (EBs). Their “Object E” covers the restoration of a place of religious worship or of historic or architectural interest.
ECCLESIASTICAL (the insurer of many churches) has a fundraising hub providing easy-to-use support, guidance and tools to help you and your church with fundraising now and into the future.
HISTORIC ENGLAND offers repair grants for historic sites at risk of being lost.
CADW offers maintenance and repair grants for historic buildings in Wales.
LOCAL AUTHORITIES. A Church of England Press Release in September 2023 announced that legislation clarifying that parish and town councils within England can provide support to churches for repairs and improvements has cleared its final stages in the House of Lords. A Government amendment to the Levelling Up Bill makes it clear that local authorities can provide grants for parish churches or places of worship, following many years of legal uncertainty. Further background is given on the Historic Religious Buildings website.
Also consider grant awarding bodies in the relevant local area. For example, in the Birmingham area, the Heart of England Community Foundation.
Many dioceses produce their own funding guides and advice on projects. For example:
Bristol Hereford Preparing applications # Most grant awarding bodies will expect to see clear plans with realistic estimates of costs and will expect to be reassured that there is reasonable certainty that the project will proceed to completion in the planned timescale.
It is preferable for someone to lead the preparation of grant requests who has previous experience of successful bid writing and has a strong commitment to the project’s success. They will be better placed to understand and follow the guidance provided by the funders. The completed documentation will still have to be agreed and signed by the PCC Treasurer, even though they may not have prepared it.
Professional bid writers offer to prepare grant applications for a fee. However, grant awarding bodies recognise that such people do not offer a long-term commitment to the project or become part of the team maintaining activities in the longer term. Some grant awarding bodies will not accept applications by professional bid writers.
If you are very lucky, a member of your band may be a professional bid writer who will do it for free! Always customise the information presented for the application being made. Although similar information may well be requested by different organisations, make sure that each response is relevant. Copying information may save time but check everything carefully – it is so easy for a tell-tale point to remain visible in a later application. If there is a word limit, then keep to it. If religious activities are not supported consider whether a bell project in a church tower would be acceptable.
Vague or unfocused requests are unlikely to be supported. Few organisations will respond to what is clearly a bland request for money. Make your application stand out in a positive way! Reviewers of a large bundle of applications soon grow weary of unclear and poorly presented information. Those reviewing applications will find it easier to recall and refer to an application that stands out for its clarity, what it aims to achieve and how it complies with the funder’s interests. It is inadvisable, however, to make stand out in an extreme way as this may irritate some reviewers.
The history of the bells and their installation along with the lives of people who have rung them (Figure 2) adds human and personal stories and is likely to enhance the case when requesting permission, particularly in the context of what items may be removed, preserved or altered. Such information will also be of considerable interest for members of the local community; local historians, school and college students may be able to undertake their own research and provide additional information that puts the project in context for the past and for the future, which is history in the making, for the next few hundred years!
Figure 3: The names on a tombstone - are there still local families in the area?
Why are applications not supported? # Funds are limited so regrettably not all grant requests will be accepted. A rejection does not mean that the project is not worthwhile, even though every rejection is a great disappointment!
Some organisations will provide feedback on grant applications. Was the application non-compliant or did it not fit the criteria well enough? Was it incomplete or unclear?

`}),e.add({id:9,href:"/docs/100-regulations-compliance/",title:"Regulations & Compliance Matters",section:"Docs",content:` Regulations &amp; Compliance Matters # During a bell project, various regulations, standards, policies and practices will be encountered. Some of these will be managed by suppliers and contractors but ringers and tower authorities should be aware of the implications as failure to observe them can have serious repercussions. Requirements related to towers within the Church of England and other jurisdictions are given in a companion document and further requirements related to Health &amp; Safety, Construction Design &amp; Management and Insurance are covered below.
Church Policies and Practices # Each church will have its own policies and practices but these are unlikely to encompass all the circumstances that will be encountered during a major programme of work in the tower. These should therefore be reviewed during planning and suitable arrangements made that will be applicable for the various stages of the project proposed. It is likely that specific risk assessments will be required for the project. The tower authorities remain responsible for ensuring that appropriate practices are adopted. Contractors will have their own practices for complying with regulations, and specific arrangements must be made for volunteers who may assist.
General Considerations # Emergency arrangements # While work is underway, there must always be at least 1 volunteer on site who knows the tower and church well At the start of work, and when different people arrive, every individual must be briefed fully A record of who is on site during the work must be maintained, with time and date of arrival and departure for each person Access to basic first aid equipment and accident record book must be available at all times Battery powered lighting should be available in case of power failure Contractors and volunteers must know how to contact emergency services and be able to advise them clearly of the building location A reliable means of communication should be maintained between individuals working on site and those who may need to contact them. Mobile phones may not be adequate if signal strength is poor CDM (Construction Design and Management) Regulations 2015 # This section has been prepared in conjunction with Safe Projects Ltd. The Construction (Design &amp; Management) Regulations 2015 (known as CDM 2015) are the main set of regulations for managing the health, safety and welfare of construction projects. CDM is a UK law that applies to all building and construction work and includes new build, demolition, refurbishment, extensions, conversions, repair and maintenance. The full text of the law may be seen here.
Work for churches is governed by these Regulations and work to bells, whether major rehangs or minor maintenance work by contractors, comes within its remit.
The great majority of ringers will not encounter CDM, but those that are involved with bell restoration work should be aware this law exists; and if the PCC for which the work is being undertaken knows nothing about it, they should be informed, as they too, are involved.
The Regulations assign responsibilities to various duty holders, which are: Client, Designer, Principal Designer and Principal Contractor. The PCC will be the Client in most cases, the Designer will be the person or company who formulates the design of the work (for example, replacement bell frames, new floors, etc), and where there is more than one contractor, the Principal Contractor will, in most cases, be the bell hanging company that is to undertake the work.
These roles have lawful responsibilities, each duty holder having responsibility for co-ordinating the work of other duty holders (for example, sub-contractors) undertaking similar but lesser roles in the project. PCCs are normally advised by the professional designer (for example, the Church Architect), who is managing the project for them - but this is rarely the case for bell-related projects, as most do not include the Architect. This might imply CDM does not apply to bell projects – it does – but many projects are short term on site and therefore do not come within the requirement to notify the project to the Health &amp; Safety Executive (HSE).
The requirement to notify the HSE of a project becomes necessary if the construction work on site is scheduled to:
last longer than 30 working days and have more than 20 workers working simultaneously at any point in the project or exceed 500 person days. It is only major bell projects that exceed these parameters (but such projects do exist).
However, while this might seem like a get-out clause for doing nothing, this is not the case. The Regulations demand, regardless of whether a project is notifiable or non-notifiable, that the Client produces a Pre-Construction Information (PCI) document for a project before the site work starts, and in turn the Principal Contractor must provide a Construction Phase Plan (CPP), which is reviewed by the Principal Designer on behalf of the Client. The Regulations require the PCI to be compiled in a way that is appropriate to the scale and complexity of the work being undertaken, in terms of relevant information being passed between the parties prior to the work starting, and thus non-notifiable work will generally include basic information rather than that needed for larger projects.
Relevant HSE Documents # The United Kingdom Health &amp; Safety Executive produces a wide range of relevant documents which are grouped here for convenience. While the documents have no legal standing outside the UK, the information provided may be useful in other jurisdictions.
Health and Safety in Construction # This free-to-download version of a printed edition is aimed at the small contractor but also applies to everyone involved in construction. It provides help and assistance on how to work safely on most tasks you will encounter. It will also help to identify the main causes of accidents and ill health and explains how to eliminate hazards and control risks. The guidance is simple but comprehensive. The solutions are straightforward and easy to adopt.
Personal Protective Equipment # Regulations covering the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) at work first came into force in 1992 (PPER 1992). These were amended in 2022 (PPER 2022). A free pdf download provides practical advice on how you can comply with the requirements of PPER 1992 as amended by PPER 2022. See also the relevant section in Belfry Upkeep.
Lifting Operations &amp; Lifting Equipment # This document describes the Lifting Operations and Lifting Equipment Regulations 1998 (often abbreviated to LOLER). These place duties on people and companies who own, operate or have control over lifting equipment. This includes all businesses and organisations whose employees use lifting equipment, whether owned by them or not.
Provision and Use of Work Equipment Regulations 1998 # This document describes regulations placing duties on people and companies who own, operate or have control over work equipment. The scope of work equipment is extremely wide, covering any machinery, appliance, apparatus, tool or installation for use at work (whether exclusively or not). This includes equipment which employees provide for their own use at work.
Control of Noise at Work Regulations 2005 # Guidance on these regulations is available as a free PDF download. In general, workers on an installation project will not be subject to damaging noises, except when bells, with clappers present, are swung as part of testing. Any workers present during this must be equipped with suitable ear defenders or earplugs.
Even though bellringing may be suspended during the work, it is helpful for neighbours to be alerted that unusual noises from equipment and machinery may disturb them.
Work at Height Regulations 2005 # The purpose of the work at height regulations is to prevent death and injury caused by a fall from height.
Control of Substances Hazardous to Health Regulations 2002 # These regulations (usually abbreviated to COSSH) require employers to control substances that are hazardous to health. There may be hazardous substances in towers, for example asbestos was often used as pipe insulation. Bat and bird droppings are highly likely in towers and pose risks to health. Further information is given here.
Any materials used in the course of the work must be disposed of appropriately. See here.
Reporting of Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations 2013 # These regulations (usually abbreviated to RIDDOR) put duties on employers, the self-employed and people in control of work premises (the Responsible Person) to report certain serious workplace accidents, occupational diseases and specified dangerous occurrences (near misses).
The Church should already have an accident reporting system.
Fire protection # Use of tools and certain materials can increase the risk of fire. Will fire exits be blocked necessarily during the work? If so, what alternative arrangements can be made and how are they to be notified to building users? Advice is provided here.
Electrical supplies # Contractors will usually make use of the church electrical supplies so these need to be checked that they are adequate for power tools. Fuse boxes and electrical mains connections should be made known to contractors so that they can isolate circuits if required. Contractors may need to bring their own generators and lighting equipment. Safety guidance on the use of electrically powered equipment is given here.
Access During the Project # The usual tower access may not be appropriate for work during a project so there may be a need for the permanent installation of walkways and steps. Temporary scaffolding or a scaffold tower may also be hired. Flooring will need to be strong enough to support the scaffold and suitable protection for fragile surfaces such as tiles may be essential. Note that scaffolding has to be inspected periodically during work and tagged. Ladders, gantries and platforms must all comply with legislation.
Scaffolding and ladders erected will make access easier to parts of the building that are not normally accessible. Additional security precautions may be necessary along with checks of insurance policies. One insurer provides a questionnaire for completion with their requirements for scaffold security.
Remember that scaffolding is expensive so minimise the period during which it will be installed.
Welfare Facilities # Adequate washing, changing and eating facilities should be provided for contractors and volunteers. If not available in the church or adjacent building then it may be necessary for suitable facilities to be hired during the project. Local ringers will be able to suggest convenient and suitably priced overnight accommodation for contractors.
Insurance # Information about insurance and ringing is available here. For bell projects more specifically, the church policy may need extension to cover bell projects and insurers should be informed of the work being undertaken.
Local volunteers are often used (with agreement of the bell hanger) to reduce the cost. Such volunteers working with the authority of the church may be covered by the church but this must be confirmed, particularly if the volunteers are under 18 or of more mature years.
Additional insurance cover may be required at certain stages, for example when the bells are at ground level in the church and hence more at risk of theft.
Security # During a project, additional people may be loaned keys or given key codes. Ensure that there are arrangements made to enable access, but that security will be maintained, with keys returned on completion of the project or combination codes changed.
Lightning Protection # Lightning protection may be disrupted or altered during the work. For example, a metal bell frame will need to be bonded to a lightning conductor. Specialist contractors will advise on temporary or permanent arrangements. More detailed information is provided here.
Safeguarding # If young people (under 18) participate in events or act as volunteers in any way during the project then the church safeguarding policy must be followed.
GDPR (General Data Protection Regulations) # The church should have a defined process for managing personal data and information. Specific arrangements must be made for how project data will be managed during and after the project.
Related to this is filing systems and record keeping. A project will amass a lot of correspondence and documents. Much of this will be electronic but there will also be some that is still paper based. The project team will need to establish and adopt systems, that can be understood by not just the primary user but also other agreed users. Some information, for example, contract quotes, funds donated, may be marked as confidential so must be managed appropriately.
Protected Wildlife # Church towers may be home to various forms of wildlife, some benign, some damaging. Some are protected – bats certainly, and some species of birds. Advice on this is given here.
Other Issues to Consider # Depending on the location of the tower and the surrounding road infrastructure, special arrangements may be required with highways authorities and neighbours to enable vehicle access sometimes several at one time, manoeuvring and parking, including for larger cranes and lifting gear. Churches will normally expect to continue their normal activities as much as possible while work is underway. Contractors will plan for equipment and tools to be cleared at appropriate times, or alternative arrangements made. Narrow doorways, monuments, timberwork and other objects that cannot be removed during the work, will need careful protection. Inevitably, any work in the tower will generate dust and debris. An organ, for example, will be particularly vulnerable and may need to be protected; organ builders are accustomed to providing this service. Protective sheeting, flooring and “tack mats” will be required, and extra cleaning support will help with keeping dust levels down throughout the work. Bell hangers are familiar with the likely risks and should advise. Some contractors will include specific requirements in their contract documents so these need to be noted and adhered to.

Resuming RInging # Since ringing will be resuming, it will be timely to alert neighbours of the completion of the work and advise them of likely ringing times for the regular services and practices. They are more likely to understand and be tolerant if they know in advance when ringing will occur, especially anything that is out of the ordinary. Include an invitation to see ringers in action and what is involved; this is an opportunity for recruiting new ringers.
Figure 1: Permanent display board about bell ringing in a church
Publicise ringing more widely in local media. Make sure there is a notice in the church porch giving time of ringing - a customisable pdf can be downloaded here. Consider display boards in the church (Figure 1).
Completing the Paperwork # Complete the records about the project, file and store them safely. Make the final entries in a project blog and dossier about the project.
The final bills should be paid, accounts reconciled and copies prepared for sponsors. Include a letter of thanks when saying that the work has been completed, along with any reports required. Aim to make these as personal and specific as possible; include a copy of a summary brochure that shows the culmination of the whole project. Some funders may require reports about the consequences of the project after an interval of several years, so ensure that records are collected, analysed and submitted by the dates due.
Follow-up Work # Even though the project is complete, remember that there may be a defined period for “snagging” and perhaps the bell hangers include a check of the installation after a period of use, a year for example. Put these in the diary and remember to follow them up. If any problems are spotted, then make sure that these are noted and attended to before the time period expires.
Saying “Thank You” # For many projects it will be appropriate to hold a celebratory event to say “thank you” to everyone involved. After all the hard work, the completion of the project and conclusion of formalities will be a relief but there will be challenges ahead not least of which will be the attraction, training and retention of ringers so remember that completion of the project is the end of the beginning not the end!

`}),e.add({id:12,href:"/docs/060-stakeholder-engagement/engagement-ideas/",title:"Ideas for Engagement",section:"Stakeholder Engagement",content:` Ideas for Stakeholder Engagement # General Points # Consider how to reach out to different groups, particularly those not normally involved in church activities, using various aspect of the project that will be relevant to different groups. The project launch will provide the stimulus for preparation of a set of materials that can be used subsequently at other events during the life of the project. Prepare information using various formats for talks and presentations, displays, leaflets, podcasts, videos, sketches, diagrams, models, artefacts etc. Versions will need to be adjusted to suit different audiences and time available – consider young people and school children, neighbours and local residents, local organisations and companies, etc. Design the information so that it will not need updating too frequently but make sure that it is kept up to date. Involve someone with artistic flair while making the information accurate and realistic, with a range of users in mind. Early in a project, develop a style that will be used throughout. This may be based on an existing style used by the church but probably customised specifically for the bells project. Consistent use of colour and a logo help to reinforce the messages about the project, make it “eye catching” and memorable. Moderate use of colour and an “open” layout rather than dense typescript, aids readability. Pictures, diagrams, charts and tables all help readers to understand what is presented and feel that they wish to participate. With any information indicate how donations may be made to the project fund: bank details, address for cheques, or electronic links. Invite people to become involved in the project and, maybe, learn to ring. What to Include # The content will include key facts about the project, the current situation, the aims, timescales, what will be involved, the people involved, and why the project is needed. Most importantly, indicate the benefits for various stakeholders. Include plenty of pictures, links to videos, as well as technical details such as plans and designs for the proposed work. Show pictures of existing bells, perhaps with indications of current problems, then with examples to show what is envisaged. Indicate the costs of parts of the work to add some reality. Put the project in context for each stakeholder from their viewpoint – benefits, history, personal connections, facilities, landmark events. Look for ideas from similar projects elsewhere, but every project is unique so show it as such. Remember that people will want to see how the project relates to them as individuals.
When incorporating information, respect copyright and make sure you have permission to use the material. Acknowledge sources and dates when accessed. Any people included in images must give their agreement - parental agreement for under 18s. Ask someone else, with an eye for detail, to read and correct information before it is published.
TOP TIP Explain the benefits for each stakeholder. Why should they be involved? Analyse carefully and have responses for &ldquo;naysayers&rdquo;. Specific Means of Communication # Build a contacts list and use this to provide updates at appropriate intervals to key stakeholders, typically by email.
Letters # In the course of a major project, letters will need to be written, some more formal, some informal. A covering letter will normally accompany forms such as applications for permission, and requests for funds. Even in the days of electronic media, a written letter, possibly handwritten, can make a better and lasting impression. It is advisable to adopt a more traditional style and ensure accuracy, with a neat and tidy appearance. Although spelling mistakes and small errors may not concern some readers, they will irritate others and could lead to an adverse response. Even if sent as an electronic attachment, care and attention to detail is advisable. Letters will probably be accompanied by other information and this too should be of high quality.
Similar information may be included in several letters but customise each letter carefully for each recipient. Make every letter personal to the recipient as that shows that they are respected and that the focus is on their interests and needs. Avoid addressing letters with “Dear Sir / Madam”: address them to a named individual with their position and credentials.
Presentations # There will be many opportunities to present information about the project. Prepare a set of “slides” for projection (typically using “PowerPoint”® software) that includes the key information about the project but adapt this to suit each event, considering the time that will be available and the likely audience.
Preparing displays and presentations benefits from teamwork – someone with artistic flair may provide the design while others provide more of the content for inclusion.
Demonstrations of handbell ringing, with tunes or change ringing, are also engaging and there are local groups in most areas.
Portable artefacts # A collection of portable artefacts will help audiences understand and reinforce memories. Local bellringers may have suitable items to loan – such as bell models, small bells, broken and worn parts from a bell installation.
Website and social media # A good website is undoubtedly essential and can be referenced by other media. The website may be hosted as part the church website and should include useful links to other websites such as those for the local ringers society. Information may be presented in charts, tables, diagrams and with plenty of pictures rather than long text. Digital presentation of information is becoming more widely used now and useful information is provided here.
The design should be clear and suitable for those who may not have the best vision. Check that the website displays as intended on a PC, tablet or mobile phone. With electronic media, the information is available globally so consider readers wherever they may be – local, national and international.
The website needs to be updated frequently. Consider the focus of the readership – one section may be for existing bell ringers, other areas for children and young people, and another for potential donors and stakeholders. Not every reader will be familiar with bell ringing jargon, so be cautious to explain the terminology and keep specialist and technical content as supplementary information for just those interested.
Web analytics can be used by the project team to see what pages are being opened (or not), or for only a very short time, so that amendments may be made to ensure that viewers do find the key information.
Remember to ask a few friends (including non-ringers) to review the website before it is made available openly, to make sure that it explains the project, and answers potential questions.
Possible online examples are:
Barrow Bells Ledbury Bells Little Horwood Bells St Mary&rsquo;s Lytchett Matravers Eastnor Church Ewhurst Bells Restoration Suggestions of other attractive examples will be welcome. Contact smSec@cccbr.org.uk.
Newsletters and blogs # These are a good way to share progress of the project, with a blog being part of the website. Pictures are ideal alongside brief text. Out of date information creates a poor impression so even when there is little to report, use the opportunity to add comments about the ringers who may be practicing elsewhere, bells and ringing nationally, the history, mathematics and so on. The Calstock Bell Ringers provide a good example.
Leaflets # Even with the widespread use of electronic media, some printed material will still be useful and remain of value to those who are less inclined to use IT. Small leaflets are useful to hand to people at events, for people to pick up from strategic locations and even distribution in the local area. Single sheets of A4 paper folded into 2 or 3 may be a suitable format and cost effective to produce. The contents might include:
An illustration of the church or its bells installation A message from a public figure, e.g. the bishop or the mayor A history of the bells and mention of historic occasions when they would have been rung Why a restoration is needed and what it is planned How local people have been involved in the past How people can be involved in future A brief description of full circle ringing A link for donations, ideally with Gift-Aid options Links to websites that give more information Include the church Charity Registration number (USA 501(C) in the USA), if appropriate.
Consider where the leaflets will be seen by people who may be interested. They may be left (with appropriate permission) in the church, tourist locations, hotels and B&amp;Bs, Tourist Information Centre, shops, community centres, libraries, businesses and so on.
Souvenir booklets # For more major projects, a more comprehensive high quality glossy brochure, booklet or book may be prepared about the project – the bells, their history, bell ringing and coupling these topics with local history, church history. With careful budgeting, these may be sold and contribute to fund raising. A second version, or addendum, may be created as a record of the project. Production of such a book, booklet or brochure is probably best suited to someone with the interest and time to commit to it (Figure 1).
Figure 1: Booklet celbrating a bells project
Posters # Eye-catching posters will be needed for specific events during the course of the project and they will need to be distributed widely. Think laterally about how they may be distributed – ask friends and family, dog walkers, parish magazine distributors etc to pin them up, with permission. If they are likely to get wet while on display, then they should be laminated but they may still need to be replaced so they remain fresh and readable. Display them where there will be plenty of people passing who will see them.
Displays and exhibitions # A display in the church will be essential. Include plenty of photographs and a brief description of the project. A working model bell is always popular and helpful! Other artefacts, perhaps worn out or broken parts can also be used to explain what will be involved in the project.
Keep the exhibition in a prominent place and ideally make it portable so that it can be taken elsewhere, perhaps to schools and colleges, shops and other public places. (But not so portable that valuable items may be misappropriated!)
Some local bell ringing societies have ready-made display boards about bells and bell ringing that is available for loan. These boards may be supplemented by information specific to the project concerned. An example is provided by The Surrey Association display boards.
Rigid display boards (Figure 2) can be cumbersome to transport and erect so compact and portable “pull up” display panels are often now preferable. Once designed, they are produced readily at low cost by local printers or online suppliers.
Figure 2: A rigid display board
“Pull up” banners roll down into the base stand when not in use and can be supplied with a carrying case. Being light weight, they are not well suited to longer term use outside.
Local press, radio and TV # Contact a presenter or editor who may have specific interest in the project. Keep in contact with them and update them at intervals. The media will want to present unusual and interesting, people centred stories, ideally with plenty of illustrations. They may be less interested in the precise details of the project and will be unlikely to have much understanding of bellringing!
Press releases should be prepared in such a form that that can be used as provided. Don’t leak information before timed press releases, and always respect confidentialities.
The press and media may wish to interview enthusiastic members of the project team. Give an interview ideally on site to introduce the project. Consider invitations at key times such as when bells are being removed from the tower and loaded onto a lorry for return to the bell foundry or, similarly, as bells arrive back from the foundry, or new bells are delivered. Photos and interviews with new ringers being trained, are always welcomed as people centred stories by the media. Indicate how other aspects of the project may be of interest for their viewers, readers and listeners – history, antiquity, music, maths etc, and how people can get involved.
Be prepared for the media to contact members of the project team at short notice – never miss an opportunity to respond positively!
Ambassadors # Aim to help others to help the project team! Ambassadors are those who are not directly involved in the bells project but engage with it enthusiastically and in turn, help raise its profile. They may help distribute information and encourage people to come to events – people who would not otherwise have become involved.
Events # Events serve various purposes at various specific stages during the project. What events will be appropriate will depend on the locality and nature of the area. What can be achieved and how in a small rural community will be very different from a large urban area or city. It is important to agree the primary aim for each event and plan for each specifically. Some will primarily be to raise money and others to engage with the community or recruit new ringers. Some will be themed around the bells and tower with the aim of engaging stakeholders, generating interest and awareness often with people who would otherwise not be involved.
Consider and agree the main focus of each event proposed. For events that are primarily money raisers, direct the greatest effort and resources into activities that will generate the largest sums. Sponsored walks, runs and other personal and group challenges remain popular and need not be organised by the fund raising team. Similarly, talented musicians in the community may be willing to organise and present a concert with proceeds donated to the bell fund.
Aim to engage with people who would probably not otherwise be involved with the church or bell ringing. Look for opportunities to participate in events organised by others to raise the profile of the project, perhaps through a display or short presentation about it. Use such events for their value in raising the profile of the project as much or more than raising money.
International visitors may be attracted to events. They are often fascinated by English style ringing as it is so different from anything that they may experience at home.
As well as organising the events, it should be possible to participate in activities or events that are organised by others and promoted widely – these could include Diocesan events, local community activities or nationwide schemes such as Heritage Open Days. These local and national occasions will bring the project, bells and bell ringing to the attention of those who would never attend an event specifically associated with bells or ringing.
Be imaginative – can the history of the bells be explained to primary school children, youth groups such as scouts and guides? Follow these by visits to the tower or other rings of bells. Events will raise questions and prompt debate – they are all opportunities to recruit potential ringers, encourage support and defuse any concerns. Every event is likely to lead to questions so be prepared to answer questions.
Suggestions for events # Figure 3: Open day advertised on church notice board
Tower open days and tours (Figure 3) - If the church already has bells that are ringable, then exploit these as both a visible and audible attraction, an opportunity to meet and talk with ringers. Many visitors will welcome the opportunity to go to the top of the tower and look over the neighbourhood. A modest charge will contribute to the project funds. Check the church insurance cover and complete a specific risk assessment. Some useful guidance is here. Arrange for a local venue to be open for a function, perhaps one that people cannot normally visit, such as a house or garden, company or historical site. Involve the support of a VIP – someone who everyone would like to meet! Exploit any local twinning arrangements when overseas visitors are in your area. Hold demonstrations of ringing and, with suitable precautions, set up sessions for people to “have a go at bell ringing” Exploit church connections with large local families – did some emigrate and still feel a connection with the area – invite them back or ask them to support the project? Include displays about bell ringing and the project at church events – harvest, Remembrance (are any ringers recorded on the local war memorial?), Christmas, Easter, Festivals, organ recitals, handbell concerts etc, guided tours of the church yard and neighbourhood, special services, Arrange guided walks to places of local historical interest, liaise with local history / archaeology groups and other societies with special interests such as (in the UK) U3A and WI. You may be able to link with other local events, for example an Open Gardens Weekend. Remember that the sale of refreshments may encourage visitors and contribute a small profit. Events may be an opportunity to identify lapsed ringers locally, or capture new ringers. Organise visits to the bell foundry to see bells being cast and all the other unique work associated with the manufacture and assembly of bell frames and fittings. Organising an event # Plan well ahead for any event, ideally with people who are accustomed to managing events in the venue that is chosen. Compile a checklist of things to be done, who is doing them and when. There are many details that are easily overlooked! Useful hints are offered here. Venues # For a bell project, the church may be appropriate, but consider whether the church is really the best venue for the type of event being planned. Would another venue be more practical? Some people not accustomed to entering churches may be more comfortable being invited to a community hall rather than the church. Some considerations to think about:
Does it have space of about the right size? Are there facilities for displays, presentations, refreshments and so on? What about parking, heating and toilets? Who to invite # For each event, involve specific stakeholders who are well matched with the purpose of the event. It is likely to be more effective to hold several smaller focused events, rather than attempting to address all interests in one large gathering. For example, events for school children and teachers can be used to explain ringing, its history, the techniques used, the music and the mathematics. Give children a small gift to mark their visit – such as a branded pencil or similar.
Other events can be for local businesses and dignitaries who may be able to support the project by cash or in kind donations. Local press and media representatives can be invited. Church and community members, are more likely to be interested if the events have a social character as well as more formal basis. Ringers from the local and wider area, will often be keen to visit for example for the “last ring on the old bells”. Aim that key people will become ambassadors for the project!
Invitations need to include a short introduction to the project and the event so that they know what to expect. Invitations need to be customised for each individual, so that aspects of the project will appeal to them. For example history, young people, traditional skills, music, engineering, architecture; the list could go on.
Publicity # Publicise events as widely as possible and well in advance, with reminders leading up to the event. What aspects of the event will attract those to be involved?
After the Event # Events take a lot of work: remember that both preparation and clearing up afterwards take far more time than the event itself!

`}),e.add({id:13,href:"/docs/070-contract-specification/technical-options/",title:"Technical Options",section:"Contract Specification",content:` Contract Specification: Technical Options # This Addendum supports the process of preparing a contract specification with descriptions of various parts of an installation which may be relevant to your tower. For those less familiar with bell installations, links are included to relevant chapters in the companion document Belfry Upkeep.
A Code of Practice on the Conservation and repair of bells and bell frames is available as a PDF download.
The Tower # For new bell installations and projects involving changes to the location of the bells, important considerations will be where and how the bells are to be (re)located in the tower. Structural engineers are likely to advise on the suitability and strength of the tower structure and its ability to accommodate the bells at the location intended. An architect may be engaged as well, particularly where alterations in the church are more extensive and design work will be required. The church architect should be informed of the work proposed, particularly any changes that will impact the visual appearance of the building internally or externally.
Architects who undertake quinquennial inspections may not be the most appropriate for design work as the skills and experience are different. Structural engineers and architects must have relevant expertise, be appropriately accredited and carry professional indemnity insurance. The Diocesan Advisory Committee and the local ringing society may be able to suggest suitable professionals. Proposed designs and materials for the installation will be suggested by the bell hangers, in conjunction with structural engineers and architects. In many projects, the existing tower structure and its heritage will influence what may be feasible. Will a historic bell frame, timber or stonework have to be retained? Techniques are now available to reduce the forces acting on a bell tower when the bells are rung full circle, for example by using a concrete ring beam as the foundation for the bell frame, lowering the level at which the bells are hung in the tower, occasionally reducing the overall weight of the bells, rehanging the bells so that they swing in directions that direct the greatest forces onto the strongest walls, and strengthening an existing frame with supplementary steel work. If compromises have to be made then care needs to be taken to ensure that the outcomes hoped for will be achieved.
Floors and ceilings, doors and trap doors, may also be replaced as an integral part of the project. It may be essential for the work itself, and a good opportunity to improve walkways (Figure 1), ladders and working platforms.
Figure 1: New galvanised steel walkway to improve access above the bells
Traditional timber ladders may need to be replaced or improved (Figure 2) but with space constraints in a tower, creative designs may be needed to accommodate a safe ladder in the space available. Caution is required to ensure that the design and installation of replacement ladders will not obstruct rope paths or space required for ringing safely.
Figure 2: Old timber ladder which may need to be replaced or improved
Such work not only facilitates the project itself, but also improves safety in the tower for subsequent routine use and routine maintenance. Care must be taken however, as towers often retain historic woodwork which may exhibit local styles and practices that have been widely lost elsewhere. The church architect will advise and heritage bodies may require some items to be retained in use or preserved.
Frame # Belfry Upkeep provides general information on bell frames. For a completely new installation, bell hangers are likely to use a metal frame that will be custom designed and fabricated. For restoration or augmentation (addition of one or bells), what can be retained of any existing frame will be suggested by the bell hangers, in conjunction with the architect and structural engineers. There may be constraints on the design and layout of the frame due to requirements to retain all or part of the existing frame, the location of items such as the staircase, clock, windows, as well as the strength and condition of the tower.
Many bell frames present difficulties of access for inspection and maintenance, particularly for more elderly Steeple Keepers. This may be an opportunity to incorporate additional steps, hand holds and small ladders. Points to be considered are:
Is a new frame to be installed and of what material? Are the foundation beams in good condition? Will it be sited at the level of an existing frame or at a different level? Moving a frame lower in the tower, below the louvres, may reduce forces on the tower and improve the sound outside, by avoiding individual bells ‘shouting out’ through the louvres. Is a historic frame to be conserved in situ for reference? If the new frame is located lower down, it may be possible to retain the old frame in situ. If this is done, arrangements will need to be made for access to the old frame for historical inspections. It will also be necessary to provide access to the louvres for installation and checking of metal grills to prevent access of wildlife. What will be the effects on the sound of the bells outside the tower and internally for the ringers? Is provision to be made for addition of more bells in future – for example, existing six bells to be rehung in a frame designed for eight with two spaces left for a subsequent project? What about the location of the clock or other items that are currently in the tower? Bells # Belfry Upkeep provides general information on bells. The history, condition, age and founder(s) of any existing bells are usually a very important consideration. information on existing bells can be provided from:
Local records Bell hangers and founders The local ringing society The Diocesan Bells adviser Specialist bell historians The Central Council Historical and Archive Workgroup The Dove database Points to consider are:
Is a bell cracked? Not all cracks are visible to the naked eye. It may be feasible to weld a cracked bell, but this is a highly specialist process. Is the bell worn where the clapper strikes? It may be possible to turn the bell so that the clapper strikes at a new point on the soundbow Does the bell have canons and will they be removed, or fitted with a canon retaining headstock? Cast in iron crown staples are better removed completely to prevent cracking of the bell. What is the tonal quality and how do the bells fit musically with each other? Can one or more be tuned? Bells that do not have a good tone may be tuned but usually only if they are not of historic interest. It will be less likely that there will be agreement to bells being tuned if they were cast prior to about 1600.
If a bell is unsuitable for retention, then they may be conserved for their historic value, perhaps configured as a chiming or clock bell or simply on display. If suitable and with permission, they may be sold or donated for use in another tower.
If a surplus bell is retained on display, care is required in the selection of its location. In spite of their weight, bells have been stolen, even when thought to be secured. Thieves value the metal, not the bell, and may simply break it up for ease of transport. If new bells are proposed, then how many, and of what weights? Is augmentation really needed? Will the outcome facilitate the attraction, training and retention of ringers? Is there a need for a fourth ring of ten within a few miles? How big or strong is the tower structure? Adding two bells to a heavier ring of eight will enable a light six to be rung (although there is a temptation then always to ring the light six, never the eight or the ten!). The options will need to be considered carefully, without just jumping to a decision!
Does the clock use the same bells, is there a chiming mechanism? Will this be restored or removed as part of the project?
Fittings # Depending on their condition, some existing fittings (ropes, wheels, pulleys, bearings, headstocks, stays, clappers…) may be suitable for reuse, repair or may have to be replaced. These items all have similar basic designs with slight variants depending on age and the bell hanger. Unless existing fittings are particularly unusual or historic, those being replaced will become surplus. Rather than paying for disposal, consider ways in which they may be redeployed once they have been removed from the tower, for cost and environmental reasons. There are various options:
Items still in good condition may be donated for reuse in another tower; local ringers and bell hangers may suggest possible locations. Create a display in the church or demonstrations elsewhere about the bell project, whether for the short or longer term. Donate to the local ringing society as items for use in training sessions for new ringers, or new steeple keepers. Sell or auction as souvenirs to raise funds, after cleaning and polishing. Wooden pieces may be carved or turned by volunteers or local college students to make items for use in the refurbished tower – perhaps a new bench, table, rope spider and coat hooks. Pieces may also be turned into a wider range of small items that can be sold to raise funds. The wood will usually be well seasoned and much appreciated by craftsmen! Larger timber beams and headstocks may be sold for architectural salvage. As a last resort, the most severely damaged or rotten timber may contribute to a 5th November bonfire – a very cost effective means of disposal! Stonework may be suitable for salvage, or even as hardcore. Metal items have sometimes been reused by enthusiasts to make ornamental items. Could the project be a zero waste project? Think about this as a goal! Note that the latest version of the Faculty Rules sets requirements for reaching net zero. Sustainability may also be expected or required by some funding organisations. If so, this should be addressed in the contract documents.
Bell Chamber # The bell chamber accommodates the bells and protects the bell installation from weather and the open environment. It is also an integral part of the complex “musical instrument” that is a ring of bells. The shape of the bell chamber, the materials from which it is constructed, and the openings in it, that determine how sound energy from the bells is dissipated within the building and how it propagates externally.
Points to be considered, especially if a new frame is installed, are:
Work on the internal masonry – making good holes left by the removal of old foundation beams, support for new ones. Access to the frame – if it is moved within the tower, modifications to doors and trapdoors may be needed. Any openings to the bell chamber must be covered by substantial galvanised wire mesh inside the tower to exclude birds. In some locations, especially in exposed coastal locations, addition of a weather resistant woven plastic mesh will reduce moisture ingress. Noise Management # Useful information on noise management, both internal and external to the tower is available in this downloadable PDF.
External to the tower # External sound management is technically a complex subject area and may need specialist advice for the most challenging environments if complaints are to be avoided.
With any changes to a bell installation, the noise levels outside the tower and the audibility of the bells by the ringers during ringing need to be considered. If the bells have not been rung for a long time (for example a year or more) or they are likely to be rung more frequently than previously, then complaints may arise from neighbours. The noise level acceptable outside the tower will depend on the buildings, their occupants and environment adjacent to the tower. The tower may be next to especially sensitive neighbours occupied day and night such as hospitals or care homes, or buildings such as schools or colleges, that do not wish for disturbance during working hours. The number of complaints by neighbours about church bells may increase, as land and property in the vicinity of towers changes. Complaints typically increase in warmer weather when people may be in gardens and outdoor spaces. Unresolved complaints about noise could contravene Environmental Protection legislation.
Clock bells chiming are more often the cause of complaints than change ringing. The clock may be set to strike every hour or additionally chime some or all the quarters. Some church clocks still strike and chime 24 hours a day, while many now have an automated system to silence the bells overnight. Adding such a mechanism may be a sensible action as part of the project. Similarly, if the clock is still wound manually, then electric winding may be much appreciated! Electric winding takes up much less space. The weights only move by about a metre so there is no need for a long drop.
It may be feasible to fit sound control “shutters” across louvres and other external openings to restrict the sound levels outside the tower. Rather than fixed installations, it is better to fit sound control that can be opened or closed readily, so that the bells are heard for services and special events but closed for bell ringing practices and longer ringing sessions (these can typically be quarter peals lasting 45 minutes to an hour, or peals lasting over three hours).
Within the tower # For ringers inside the tower, the bells must be clear as well as audible, but not so loud that “calls” (instructions during the ringing) cannot be heard. This means that the floor below the bells (which may or may not also form the ceiling above the ringing room) may need additional sound insulation. Suitable materials must be used to produce the effect required, but also considering the risks such as from fire and the attraction of pests.
Ringing Room # The area where the ringers stand to ring the bells is usually of greatest interest for the ringers, but also for other church users particularly when the bells are rung from ground level. While most of the work in the bell project will be further up the tower, the project should also take the opportunity to improve the condition of the Ringing Room, particularly if the bells are a new addition or if the tower has been silent for a long time.
For those involved in the project who are unfamiliar with bell ringing, it is very helpful for them to be shown ringing in a few different towers so that they can see some of the requirements and constraints, potential hazards and risks. Each tower is unique but many factors will be common.
The access, rope draught, ventilation etc are likely to be determined by the existing tower structure, but advice will be provided by the bell hangers, architect and structural engineers. A ground floor ringing room enables disabled or less active ringers or visitors to access. A project is a good opportunity to improve safety at accesses and on staircases; remembering to provide for both routine use and emergency evacuation. Emergency lighting may be an essential addition.
With the covid pandemic, ventilation has become very topical. Windows should be made openable wherever possible to provide sufficient ventilation, while remaining secure. If there is no or very limited natural ventilation, as in some tower structures, then creating a source of fresh air should be considered seriously.
Improved electrical supplies for power tools and lighting may be essential for the duration of the project and additional efficient heating may make the environment more welcoming for ringers who are now accustomed to higher standards than formerly. A guide to improving the tower environment is here.
A project will also offer an opportunity to install training aids such as simulator and / or dumbbell, if not already in place.
Some ringing rooms are open to the whole church, so are draughty and cold, expensive to heat, especially for short periods. Ringing involves physical exercise so ringers will prefer a ringing room to be at a lower temperature than normal domestic room temperatures of 19-20C. However, some heating to take the chill off, especially for those waiting to ring, will be welcome in winter. A glazed screen or partition may be acceptable as part of the design, even heavy full-length curtains (Figure 3) will make a marked difference to the retention of heat and economy.
Figure 3: Curtains help to keep ringing room warmer in winter
Ringing rooms may be shared by other church users as vestries, storage, meeting spaces or to accommodate other church fixtures such as the clock or monuments. In some projects the layout and users is changed so discussions are essential between other users and experienced ringers to ensure that the space required for ringing remains safe and appropriate. Space needs to be left behind the circle of ropes (and up to ceiling level) for the ringer to stand and ring safely, ideally a metre or more from any other furniture, fixtures or fittings. The circle of space in front of the ringers also should be clear or at most accommodate a low table, for example, that does not obstruct the view across the tower or risk catching ropes.
Even though bells and their larger fittings are likely to only enter and leave the tower every hundred years or more, free space must be left accessible along the whole path vertically through from the bell chamber to ground level. There are instances where a kitchen or other facilities have been constructed so that major work would necessitate the removal of these facilities if work on the bells was to be undertaken!
Agreeing the décor, furniture and fittings in the ringing room will require agreement from all parties; and decisions over colour schemes, floor covering and similar items can lead to some of the lengthiest debates. What seems to be minor detail can often cause heated discussion, such as the colour of a new carpet!
The materials and construction of the walls and flooring may limit what will be approved. Although ringers understand that the area used for ringing may have to be used for other purposes, (storage of choir robes, flower arranging items, Christmas decorations, chairs and tables, other church property), it is inappropriate for the ringers to be expected to move many and substantial items before ringing. Ringing rooms should not be viewed as large empty spaces for the storage of things “…. that might be useful sometime”!
Building a gallery or new ringing room at a higher level may be one of the major outcomes of a project. The height of a ringing room is usually greater than that of a domestic room – probably 12-15ft (4-5m). If very much higher than this, then there may be a recommendation to insert a rope guide (Figure 4), but less than this will make handling the bell ropes difficult.
Figure 4: Rope guide fitted in a tower with a long draught between the ringers and ceiling
The addition or alteration of rope guides requires Faculty permission and advice from the church architect; this is an example of a structural change. Ringing from the ground floor enables ringers to be better integrated with the church as they are visible. If moving the ringing room to a higher level, then the ringers may then not be visible and feel out of contact. There will be a need for the ringers to have some way of communication with the ground level, for example to see when the bride arrives for a wedding. Installation of a simple battery or electrically operated bell or warning light will be sufficient. A glazed screen is a good way in which a gallery can be enclosed but also enable the ringers to be visible (and warmer in winter!) but with suitable ventilation.
Access # Access to a new higher level ringing room may be via an existing spiral staircase. If this is not the case and a new staircase is to be created, then space will be occupied, and its style will need to fit. In some towers, a basic set of stairs may be appropriate, but where the staircase will be visible to the church, then an original and more aesthetically pleasing design may be conceived. This is where an architect should be able to exploit their skills, in matching the new work into the existing structure.
Finishing Touches # Finishing touches are also important – all make the environment more welcoming and helpful for ringers.
It is also worthwhile enabling non-ringers see ringers in action and the bells themselves turning, if possible. If the ringers are not visible, then CCTV and suitable lighting may be installed that show the ringers and bells in use.
