Ringing bells full circle is not just a church activity; it is part of our national heritage. A four hundred year old tradition, it offers challenges and requires skills which most people are able to achieve. Whilst it is based at the parish church and is a part of the worshipping Christian community, a band of ringers is part of the social life of the parish.</description></item><item><title>Scoping the Project</title><link>https://belfryprojects.cccbr.org.uk/docs/020-scoping-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://belfryprojects.cccbr.org.uk/docs/020-scoping-project/</guid><description>Scoping the Project # A bell project may start as the seed of an idea or it may already have been discussed in a committee such as the Parochial Church Council (PCC). This chapter suggests how to develop the initial ideas so that other people may become involved and start to appreciate what may be achieved. This will help the project come to a successful completion. No two projects will be the same so these notes offer guidance that may be considered rather than a step by step guide.</description></item><item><title>Getting Specialist Advice</title><link>https://belfryprojects.cccbr.org.uk/docs/030-specialist-advice/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://belfryprojects.cccbr.org.uk/docs/030-specialist-advice/</guid><description>UNDER CONSTRUCTION
Getting Specialist Advice # It is only with specialist advice that the full scale and scope of a project is likely to be determined. Every tower and ring of bells is unique so advice on the tower and bell installation will have to relate to each project specifically.
As with other major projects and purchases, many people will be concerned that they do not know where to start, where to obtain advice or even what advice will be needed.</description></item><item><title>Managing the Project</title><link>https://belfryprojects.cccbr.org.uk/docs/040-managing-project/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://belfryprojects.cccbr.org.uk/docs/040-managing-project/</guid><description>Managing the Project # A plan to go from this… # Picture here
As a project takes shape there may be enthusiasm to make progress, particularly start raising money. However, it is advisable to plan the project, considering in some detail what has to be done when, how, by whom, with what resources first. The plan will ideally run from the earliest discussions through to project completion. Careful planning should reduce the overall duration, save money and make sure that the whole project runs smoothly and meets its aims.</description></item><item><title>Project Team</title><link>https://belfryprojects.cccbr.org.uk/docs/050-project-team/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://belfryprojects.cccbr.org.uk/docs/050-project-team/</guid><description>Project Team # UNDER CONSTRUCTION
A project may be proposed by one or two individuals with ambitions to achieve certain outcomes. However, it is usually better for a small group of people with a wider range of skills, interests and experiences to work together to make the project a success. It is advisable that the project is not the direct responsibility of an existing committee such as the PCC as that will usually have many other commitments and structured ways of operating; the team will need flexibility to plan the work and establish ways of working that will achieve the outcomes intended.</description></item><item><title>Stakeholder Engagement</title><link>https://belfryprojects.cccbr.org.uk/docs/060-stakeholder-engagement/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://belfryprojects.cccbr.org.uk/docs/060-stakeholder-engagement/</guid><description>Stakeholder Engagement # UNDER CONSTRUCTION
